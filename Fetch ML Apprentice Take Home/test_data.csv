"I had an incident where I was driving and some drivers in a busy intersection just kept piling up and blocked my half of the intersection when it was time for me to go. I immediately just snapped and decided to do the dumbest thing ever and swerved into the oncoming traffic lane to get around without even seeing anyone there. Fortunately I did not get in an accident but I was damn near close. I have noticed that my self confidence has been so shot that I feel incapable of even functioning in society and this incident certainly validates that. I feel that life for me has no consequences and I continue to be self destructive.I have experienced lots of emotional abuse in my upbringing and throughout my life and I cannot ever think calmly and practically because I feel like everyone is breathing down my neck. Its gone too far to the point where I feel like I cannot leave the house. If any of you know, what is the most effective best thing that I can do for myself to escape this mentality?Thank you Is reckless behaviour associated with depression?",Depression
Can you kill yourself with nytol just curious Nytol,Suicidal

"The first time I tried to kill myself was at 12 years old. I googled how much Tylenol I needed to take to overdose not realizing that overdosing did not mean death and I failed. I got into drugs after high school and overdosed on heroin like 4 or 5 times. Each time I either woke up or was saved by someone. I guess ""saved"" is not the word I would like to use because death would have been a relief, but still, there it is. I hate my life. I have a great job, a great girlfriend, great friends, and a loving family, but it does not seem to matter to me. What I want most in this world is for my life to end. Everything just seems pointless no one has ever been able to convince me otherwise.I am going to be poor forever. there is no hope of retirement or becoming independently wealthy, which I think might be the only thing I would have to look forward to.Every single day I struggle to get out of bed, pretending that I want to go to work. The fact that I have to slave away at a meaningless job in order to survive kills me inside. There does not seem to be a point to anything.In 40 or 50 years I will finally die, but why the hell should I allow myself to suffer for that long? Happiness does not seem real or even worthwhile since I am going to die anyway and everyone who cares will also die.I hate living so much. I never asked to be born yet here I am desperately trying to fake it. All I want is for this life to be over. I do not even care about heaven or hell, both of which I do not believe in. I do not care about a legacy or having kids or a family. None of it seems fair to anyone else when I would just be faking it the entire way.If I did not have a girlfriend I would be dead already. I love her so much that I cannot get myself to leave her in pain. But I want it so bad. I want to die more than anything else in this world. Idk what I am expecting to hear but I guess I just needed an outlet. I will probably try and end my life for real eventually but until then I guess I will just struggle on and pretend to be happy.Sorry for the post I guess, I know I am not asking anything or seeking out advice but I have no one I can actually talk to. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist who both do not take me seriously and think pills will help. They do not. They just make me sleep better which I guess is a relief of some sort, but nothing helps. I have tried so many different kinds of meds and professional help. Nothing fixes anything.I fantasize about the day I finally grow the balls to kill myself but I cannot separate myself from anything or anyone keeping me alive. I am just absolutely miserable. I envy all these people I see going about their days happily, liking working their lives away. I just cannot do it. I guess that is all I have to say. I really hate being alive",Suicidal
"This is just another message to the void please do not respond or care. Nobody has ever cared or been there. I cannot continue anymore. I just cannot. I cannot do this thing they call life. I have no reason or purpose anymore, I never have. I cannot. I know Its does not matter to anyone but please just care about someone, anyone. I have been so alone for so long I am leaving this whatever it is in hope that when you see someone cry out for help. Grab them and hold them let them know someone is there that cares and that they are not alone in the world. Goodbye blue marble. I cannot, I just cannot",Suicidal
"I am just tired of it all. Were it not for a few bright things and people in my past I would have been gone a long time ago. I make the same mistakes. I feel invisible when I am not feeling like a burden. I have been able to feel love longer than I can remember. I feel unrepairable. . It physically and emotionally hurts to live. I moved to a different country to start a new life. Tiny things improved, but in the end I am just defective. I am not meant to be anything more than I am. Years and years have proven that.&amp;#x200B;I just want to sleep. 40 yrs old. Tired. Failed 3 attempts in the past.",Suicidal
"I was 17 when I shared an intimate picture of my then gf, who was 18, with a stranger online about a year ago. I regretted it immediately and deleted it. It also did not have her face so it at least it will not ruin her life. I ended up confessing a while later out of fear, the guilt came later. Her, being the angel she was, was willing to stay and work it out, but eventually she left because she could not move on. Why did I do it? Because I got a fucking kick out of it for one moment. I was exposed to fucked up shit from a young age and had a lot of creeps who ""talked"" to me. I knew I was fucked up, but never thought it would affect my relationship with this perfect girl. I was a loner for most of high school and pretty much everyone thought I was a loser and I had a crush on this girl. I somehow got to be with her like it was a movie. Turned out I was the villain.Last time I posted this, I got a sympathetic response probably because I made myself seem better than I am, so I decided to go with a more objective approach to what happened this time. Some days I feel better knowing she has moved on and people make mistakes, but days like today, I deserve to die. I want her to put a gun to my head and shoot me because I emotionally scarred her and we loved each other so much. She trusted me. I tried doing stuff to myself, but I am too much of a coward to finish the job. Parents found out, but that died down. When we broke up, I had a tough time and everything was going wrong, but that was okay because I deserved it. I wanted to suffer, but now things have started to get better in my life and I hate it. I hate that I am alive and God is not punishing me more. I feel like I need her permission to live. I like to starve myself, dunk my head in ice water, or do something so I do not go insane. My counsellor ignored my last email after I missed her call.I do not want her to be sad because of me. She was so nice and I broke her. She said she forgave me, but I want to make it right. I wish we never met, so she could still be smiling. I am so sorry.Sometimes, I feel like this is the only life I have so I have to accept reality. But I did something unforgivable and at the moment, I cannot handle reality.I wrote this very fast in an emotional state so forgive any mistakes in it. I am a piece of shit",Suicidal
"Last Sunday something happened in my friends life that made her not want to be my friend and delete all her social media, I still have zero idea what happened. I called the police to do a welfare check on her because in the past this has happened with family members because and the police need to be called to help. The police check on her and call me to tell me she is fine. That was the last update.She originally blocked me on everything and then unblocked me a little while later and then deleted everything she had. I know she is in a crisis at the moment so I am not angry or annoyed with her, I am just concerned. In the last she is told me she is used an app called Vent so I decided to download it to see if she is posted anything. She posted a few hours ago talking about working out and how happy she is now she is alone and does not have to impress anyone. she is happy she is alone... I never even got to meet her.I miss her My best friend vanished.",Depression
After suffering with depression for the past 20 years and getting over it at points I feel like I am back at square one again. I have not felt this bad in years. I am just sat at a lake listening to Pink Floyd and wanting to throw myself in it (I cannot swim for heck) I hate this darned feeling. Why am I back here.,Suicidal
"I am 14, I told my crush I like him and he likes me back but I do not want to date him, tbh I regret telling him cus I could have just gotten over him but now I know that he likes me back Ill feel bad if I get over him. I do not want a crush cus I feel like it distracts me a lot from my studies and I am not emotionally or mentally mature enough to be in a relationship, I feel like such a shitty person, why does he like me when I am so horrible and indecisive and insecure? Whenever I am alone or late at night, I struggle to fall asleep, I keep thinking of my failures and I am rlly scared that Ill disappoint my parents and be unsuccessful, I feel rlly lonely whenever I am not with my frds, it not that I want to kill my self or die, i just feel rlly empty inside like I have no purpose in life, I wish I could just disappear but without my loved ones being sad from it tho. I kind of want something rlly tragic to happen to me so Ill have a excuse to die, i know that once something rlly bad does happen Ill will not actually want that but its just a thought I am constantly having. I know I do not have it that bad, and others have it way worst so I feel horrible for complaining and feeling this way, I should be grateful for what I have, its just sometimes I wish this privilege was given to someone else since I do not deserve it. I feel rlly empty",Depression

"I need to rationalise how I am feeling. I need to talk to someone with an ear to lend. I feel so hopeless and jaded, I have come to a place in life where I am doubting the validity of it all, doubting whether I should wait to find out. that is what happened when you are trapped. Feeling lonely, low, defeated and small. Can anybody talk to me. I am in pain",Suicidal
"I feel like the only reason I do not rage quit the fuck out of here is because of my family. My wife is amazing, so are my parents and they are doing everything they can but there is only so much they can actually do when I just hate living on this fucking planet and I hate people and today's society so much. And I know that everyone who loves me would blame themself if I did it and it is honestly (of course) not their fault. So now, I am just living my normal everyday life, hoping that a bus will hit me or I will die in a car accident. Or do you think I am just too much of a coward to do it and the whole ""oh it is because of my family"" is just a stupid excuse? Just out of curiosity.",Depression

"I do not know why things are so complicated but still simple. I am 18 (M) and feel a lot of weight of having to perform and earn a decent living for myself but also the expectation of having significant other too.I am now on a walk after helping my dad out with work because I felt like shit (not because of the work or my dad).If anything the walk just made me feel physically tired and lonely and shit. I thought this walk would be nice and refreshing but it was the total opposite. I just wanted to feel something nice but all I really feel is lonely and emptiness.Little things slowly nibble away at me:- Being denied a job opportunity for work experience- Seeing my friends hang out but I am just lonely af- Seeing others together and happy then I question what is wrong with me- Having in the back of my head that everyone else is going off to uni and having a great time and I am stuck by myself trying to scrape things up to hopefully get into pharmacy school (I do not even have much interest, I am only doing it to earn money because my interests will not be able to earn me sufficient money to live- Just feeling like nothing will get better despite my efforts which also just makes it harder to be and consistently stay motivated- Me gaining weight and looking less attractive than I already am.Any advice is appreciated, thank you for taking your time out of your day to read this.

"Recently, I was forced to leave my year old semi feral cats as I relocated to a new area, and the poor, skittish creatures could not handle the change. So they stayed while I moved to my new place. I have been a wreck since then. Almost everything in my life reminds me of them. I miss them unbearably and do not know how to cope. I have been crying throughout the days and I just do not want to do anything other than either cry or hug my cats somehow. They were my closest companions in the lonely post pandemic world. I cannot even fully express my feelings to anyone in real life because they will all make fun of me. I am in so much pain right now, worried sick about my cats who keep crying for me, I have been told. This is terrible. Being forced to leave my cats has triggered a downward mental health spiral",Depression
"Greetings everyone. I do hope you are having a good day/night. I have come here to post my final message, thank you to all who will read it and please hold on tight to your life. I have seen many things throughout my life. I lost my father and several other family members early on. My mother was beaten and spit at by my father and grandmother when she was pregnant with me. That is all I will mention here abuse wise. I grew up alone without any supporting figures. I have survived a war in my country, although it lasted only a few months, it was still not a pleasant experience. I was used by people I thought were friends and I was in three toxic relationships. I have tried ending it dozens of times but I just could not do it. Now that I finally have nothing, actually nothing, only confusion and pain, I do believe I can do it today. I used to be a happy optimistic kid and now it is a shame to see myself as corpse (mentally) I wish I made the right decisions and did not traumatise myself even further. I regret what I have done, mental instability was never an excuse to harm or plot against others, neither can it ever be an excuse to hurt animals. Please please please get therapy as soon as you feel something is wrong, I did not do that and it was the biggest mistake I can think of. Please hold on everyone and do your best to work with what life has given you. I wish for others to not end up like I did, I wish for others to be at least somewhat happy. Farewell people, I do not know any of you but the only thing I hope for is that you do not go through what I have. That your heart does not die, that your hope does not die. And I assure everyone that someone out there cares. The decision is mine, I have already been considering it for a long time. I know I could have kept going and achieved something. But with the near insane state my head is in, to keep going would only be torture. Today is the day",Suicidal
"The past couple years have changed me and really put things into perspective for me (I am in the US). I have lost all motivation and reason for doing things, I am always negative and pretty much constantly worry about death. I have gotten so fucked up mentally this past year. I have become extremely depressed, I stopped working out, to do any of my hobbies is a chore for me, I hate my job and cannot find a new one or figure out what to do with my life, I am always snippy and short tempered with my family. I did not go to my sister's birthday BBQ last night because I knew I would just bring my dread, depression, and misery with me. I do not think I am suicidal but it is definitely the easier option and I have considered it alot recently. I do not see much to look forward to if the world is ending and there is political mayham in almost every country. Seriously why cannot people realize we are all in this together and billionaires and corporations can fuck off. I really related to Bo Burnham's Inside and recently cannot get ""All Eyes on Me"" out of my head. I feel like this great life I had planned from when I was young got ripped away from me. what is the point of a pointless, meaningless job, if I am not helping people or trying to save the planet? what is the point of having kids, if they will just see the end of the earth? what is the point of getting married, I will just be miserable and alone forever?

I do not know what to do currently working two jobs and paying bills since I moved into my girlfriends place with her family. Getting away from my mom was good but I have been made aware of so much of my mental illness since I came here. I dissociate often and go through long episodes of depersonalization. I ask myself if anything even exists anymore, or if I killed myself long ago and this is hell.

So I have suffered with bi-polar most of my adult life (I am 36 now) This last year has been tough. Not just because of the pandemic but family issues as well. I have the support of my wife and luckily a really good mental health nurse. But I do not plan when I want to kill myself. Its always really impulsive. Which is quite dangerous - because I do not have any trigger signs where I am like okay I need to do something Anyway I took one this week. Zopiclone - 28 tablets 7.5mg. Wife phone the police and ambulance. Police turned up first. They were fine (I have had previous police visits and they have been utter knobs) ambulance rolls up. I am feeling pretty woozy now. So straight to hospital for me. On a drip - blood tests and stomach pumped. Nurses and Drs were actually sympathetic (I have had it again where they treat you like shit) then I had to see the mental health worker - explained to her it was impulsive I do not want another new mental health nurse. Then the next few days after have been rough as fuck. Constant sickness. Foggy head. Pins and needles all over. The sense of I cannot even kill myself. Another thing to add to the ever growing failure list. But I am still here. Writing this. So part of me is gripping on. What happens when an overdose does not work.,Depression

"Background info: there is something wrong with me where when my stuff is moved around or organized differently it makes me freak out its such a horrible feeling. Idk why, it makes me have this huge rage I cannot control and flail my body around and it always makes me want to sh a ton (but I cannot bc my parents know I sh and check). My parents have organized my rooms lots of times without telling me and every time it becomes some huge fight. My room gets messy a lot because of my depression and my parents get upset about it and stuff. I am 18 and I cannot afford to move out even though my relationship with my parents would be 10x better if I could. I was on vacation for a week with a friend of mine and I was excited to get back. My moms appendix ruptured when I was gone, and every single day I would bike out far where I could get service just so I could check up on her. Before I got back I called my dad and I asked if anything was organized differently bc I really did not want that and I woukd rather know in advance. He said no. But when I got home, a bunch of my stuff have been hung up on my walls. To a normal person this probably is not a big deal but for me for some reason it makes me feel like my skin is burning and the world is ending. I cannot control it and I do not know why. One was my art project I worked on for WEEKS. So I tore it all down, and I very carefully tried to take my project down and it ripped on the side. That makes me so upset it was my favorite thing I have ever made. So I walked into my parents room and was flipped out and I was like there things on my wall when you told me you would not, and my project ripped. They got very mad and just told me to leave. The next day I went to talk about it. It was the biggest fight we have ever had. And I tried to explain my side and I apologized for getting upset, but explained I am very frustrated bc idk how to fix my project and they know this makes me upset and it has become a pattern. They yelled at me and said things like do you know how much we do for you!and I said yes and I appreciate that but I am just trying to explain this. They also brought up how one time they had to reorganize my room because I was going to the mental hospital and that they did not have a choice, I said I understand that and I am not upset about that (expect for the fact that when they cleaned it that time they threw away a letter from my best friend that I had to dig up from the trash). They go do you think we wanted to have to dig through your room looking for things you could use to cut yourself! And your room was disgusting and It was like a horders room! I was extremely depressed at the time, so yes my room was a mess but I was to depressed to care at the time its not like that anymore. Like I am sorry I am a burden to the whole family. Clearly I hate myself already. They did not have to be so mean. I do not know what is wrong with me but I wish they would have just talked about it instead of yell at me and say mean things. I am so fucking tired of living and so tired of not being able to sh. I just got in a huge fight with my parents",Depression

"Two thoughts i would like to share today. How i feel and how i see myself in the future. Maybe I am being selfish coming here with ""such a small thing"" but i cannot see myself talking to anyone about this. So, i live in the contradiction of ""having a perfect life"" and finding no joy in whatsoever. I am only 21, currently in med school, i have family, a few friends, used to get laid sometimes before quarentine, have not lost anyone to covid due to our hard isolation. Yet, i still feel like nothing can make me happy. Things i used to enjoy are no longer fun, and i have no new interests at all... feels like things are not ""worthy"" (like ""oh, ofc i want to play guitar, but uh, it takes so much effort, i do not want to anymore). Nowadays i just wake up with no motivation whatsoever do the hateful remote college stuff and wait for the night, when i cannot sleep and, for no reason at all, feels so lonely, so empty, so lacking the reason to wake up tomorrow that i want to seat in the room and drink until i forget who i am and sleep. Tbh, even that is denied, cuz i have epilepsy and alchool makes me convulse. I do not want to kill myself, but i do think about, and i figured out i woudnt do it because ending it now feels like a selfish decision to my parents, my dog and probably half the world whom would envy my life. When i think of my future, on other hand, every scenario leads to this: I am coming home late night after some pacient die in my hands. Parents dead/old enough to care. All by myself getting a drink and finally getting the guts to mix my own damn medications with some other pills.

"I feel hopeless! I cannot eat, cannot sleep, cannot remember the last time i laughed! This all started once i decided to check up on my childhood friends from school. I am 24 years old and due to anxiety and depression I have had since i was eighteen led me to isolate myself everyone i knew. So fast foward to now. I went on linked and saw that my old friends are graduating with msc at the age of 24 and i started college jan 2021 but i fucked up my first semester. Ill be graduating at 27/28 with no Work experience. I feel hopeless. What makes it worse is that, is that i have zero self confidence due to my shitty childhood. My mom taught me to be afraid of everything and my dad beat the shitout of me and always told me i was dumb. But at 24 i cannot wait life to get better specially knowing how low my self-esteem. Through out my uneventful life i was always felt like i was going to grow up and have fun and exiting adulthood. But now i see that is not the case. The only thing stopping me from ending my life is, the pain it will bring my family. And also due to my religion. But incase this does not get better, what is the easiest way to commit suicide?do not have a gun. And i do not want to hang myself because, its painful, long and i would not know how to do it.

"have not really sought much help, I was convinced I was going to kill myself by now but I do not think I can bring myself to traumatize my fianc like that. My biggest issue is not being able to talk to others very well, my mind just *always* goes blank when conversation is needed, except when I am with my fianc. Not being able to talk with people on the level I want to kind of causes me to spiral out and get more depressed, which just makes social situations even worse, and I end up usually just avoiding them, which makes me more depressed of course. What do you guys do to get past that? Trying to push myself to get through this and be better, how do you guys escape your cloud and be social instead of running?",Depression
"Me - 24M My Partner 29F I have undiagnosed anxiety - at least I think I do. Whatever it is, its taken a toll and ruined most of the romantic relationships I have been in. And its rearing its ugly head again, or I am. (I am trying not to place the blame on the anxiety, I need to own it)I have been obsessively checking my partners location using Find My - even when I know where she is (work, home, sisters, etc) It occurred to me recently, What would I do if she was not where she said she was? It always worries me when she (or my past partners) would go out for the night to hang out with friends and have a few drinks. I get this overwhelming feeling that they are going to find someone better, bring them home and be unfaithful; just the thought of it makes my stomach turn. I want to be able to tell myself that is not likely and get out of my own head but Its all I can think about. It does not help that my current partner is Bipolar 2 and has manic episodes where her sex drive is elevated - that scares me even more. What if she needs to scratch that itch and I am not around? What if she is mad at me and does it to get back at me? What if this? What if that? Its a deep rabbit hole. To pile on the crap, she works retail and I have an office job so there is several hours every night that I try to keep myself busy and not imagine her sneaking off from work to be with someone else. Speaking of work, she is fairly new at this job in a management position and they are already talking about moving her to a new store possibly out of state as the next step career wise. Now this is not for a few years but I have got obligations here that make it more challenging for me to pack up and move to a new state if that is what happens. She, she just has me and lately its felt like she would be willing to drop me like a sack of potatoes should the offer come up.Its been a recurring argument; we never have time for just us you are always on about workJust be present with me they call you in every day, even on your days off its taxing to say the least. We talked recently and it came up that our priorities are out of order Hers are: 1. Her career 2. My Career 3. Our relationship Mine are: 1. Our relationship 2. Our careers It just feels like she is not willing to compromise at all. I have asked her multiple times if she would be willing to but its always I do not know what my plan is yet I do not want her to give up her future for me but I do not want to be considered when she thinks about her future, that does not seem crazy, right? The icing on the cake is I have developed a little bit of a weed addiction. Problem is - I work for Uncle Sam. And also, I act like such a child when I am high. I try not to I try to be chill like everyone else but when I am high is the only time I feel like I can not worry about everything else.So yeah I act like a child when I am high because the rest of the time I have to hold everything together and its this sweet sweet release from that. I do not know what the point of this rant is - is it a confession, is it a rant, I just want to be heard, validated maybe. What does it look like from the outside?Ask questions for clarification if you want. I feel like my anxiety is ruining my life",Depression

"Well here it goes since this is my first post here and just looking for a positive comment or maybe some advice. I will start off by saying that I am 21 and unemployed. I have a GF and we are great together. I have family that is within an hour drive. I have a decent support system in my life. But lately I have just felt bland about everything. Any hobbies I enjoyed have kind of died and I do not have much hobbies other than gaming. While I have been unemployed for the last few months I have been trying to get my head straight, I quit my E-Cigarette mid May. Used to smoke alot of weed. Now I have cut back and using that as a reward instead of a nightly ritual. Since I have been off work I have been trying to figure out what my interests are and what I could see myself doing in the future as a steady career. I will be honest... I am a lazy guy. I go for walks sometimes to get me out of the house. Listen to podcasts. Apply for jobs. Gaming seems to be the only thing that I slightly enjoy simply because all the action is happening infront of me, I am not physically moving but I am controlling what is happening in the game so that is entertaining for me. I have gotten job offers and I always find something wrong with them, whether it be the commute, the pay, or the hours (too early or too late). I just cannot seem to get any traction, any motivation. I just do not really know what to do. I look at our planet and hate it because it is dying and we HAVE to do something but big company's are not doing anything. Society is breaking down slowly but surely. I do have a doomsday mindset I will admit and I am trying to kick it, but it is hard when there is so much negativity and so little positivity in the world. Everyone just keeps saying to me ""you will be back on your feet and feeling better once you get a job"". For some reason I do not believe them. I feel like I do not fit in this world sometimes, that I am a wasted space. That I do not want to live, but I do not want to die either. I just simply exist and I am not enjoying it as much as I once did. So what is a good stepping stone to start with? A rant about myself",Depression
"Hey guys - I am 32M, and have had pretty severe depression and anxiety for many years now. When I think about it, I think it all started with my mother's death when I was a child, but for many years I buried everything, I got on with life, did not complain, went to school, went to work, did ok in life. But somewhere around the age of 21 I just cracked, I started having sleep problems, I felt anxious and depressed and even had nightmares about my mother a lot and I just could not function. But instead of seeking help I tried to just march on with life, as I had done before, but this time I was not able to. Things got worse, I was isolated, did not respond to messages/calls from people I knew, became more isolated and tried to commit suicide. I wish I had known that I was genuinely depressed. As strange as it sounds I had no idea what was going on with me. Not a single person noticed in my life, they were terrible with things like mental health etc. Not an ounce of support or understanding, just a tacit understanding that I should not talk about anything like this.I spent a period of 2-3 years pretty much bed ridden, even more isolated, lonely, health failing, mind crumbling. But with therapy and medication managed to crawl out of that hole. It has been 10 years now, 10 years of struggle and I still cannot believe it has been that long. I have been destitute, alone, isolated, homeless for a period, jobless for long stretches. Basically just so unwell that I was not able to ever plan for anything, or get my life back together. I was taking it an hour or a day at a time. There were days when just brushing my teeth was an achievement. But how could I explain this to someone? I could barely look after myself.I managed to start medication and get therapy and that was a huge help, and for the past 3 years or so I have been doing ok, but there are still moments when the pain I carry from those difficult years are hard to shake off. I thought I had friends, I thought I had family, but when the time came I was truly alone. Not a single person really helped me, and that broke my heart and changed many of my relationships. I do not feel the same, even though I still see some of these individuals...Anyway, long story short, I think I am doing ok now, but at times it really gets me down when I think of all the time I have lost, I know there is nothing I can do about it, and on better days I tell myself just to carry on and it will be ok. I try not to compare myself to friends or anyone else, but at times I look around and see people I know, people who were at one stage the same as me, and they are doing great in terms of career and relationships, and I am truly happy for them, but I see myself and it really crushes me. It dawns on me how truly sick I was and how much time I have lost, and it is hard to get myself out of that hole. I feel like I still struggle a lot and it has cost me relationships/friendships and also financially/career-wise. I look healthy, I am tall, have hair, in very good shape, but I cannot seem to tell anyone, a few times I have tried but how do you open up with such heavy stuff. Family members have just dismissed me, and acquaintances sometimes cannot believe me because they say I look like I am well. But deep inside, there are days and weeks where I feel such pain that I do not know if I can carry on.I do not know why I am posting this today, I have had an ok week, but this morning I woke up and just felt terrible. I am still on medication and yesterday picked up some more from the pharmacy. The only thing is because I take generic sertraline sometimes the brands change, I do not know if my mood has anything to do with the fact that I started taking another brand of sertraline the other day...but I just feel so low right now, have not felt like this in months, I feel like killing myself, it is a horrible soul-crushing feeling and I feel like I should hang myself to just stop feeling this. It just crept up on me all of a sudden. I know this sounds a bit negative but I just needed to reach out and talk to some fellow human beings, and just be heard and listened to, I do not have anyone I can tell and I feel like I am drowning right now. I feel such profound pain it is almost making me cry, which never happens. Like my mood is just out of whack and cannot be controlled.Please, anyone, help, suggest something or just say you hear me and that I am not alone. I really need to just talk to someone, or to be heard. Having a really bad day.",Depression

"Originally posted on the r/suboxone, I thought it might be more appropriate here. But peeps, kindly let me know where it should go. AnywayJust wondering if anyone is in the sameboat. My story of addiction is a short one compared to many but this post is long so Ill provide a concise TLDR at the end. My mother (who I was extremely close to and saw every single day, even when I lived by myself) died suddenly in her sleep a week after my 27th birthday. As you can imagine, the word devastated does not do it justice. I already had been battling depression since I was a little girl, never without any relief (SSRIs, NDRIs, atypical, even ketamine infusions followed by sublingual ketamine drops. The only thing I have ever tried is an MAOI). They finally put me on adderall for several years for treatment resistant depression. It got me out of bed, made it so I could hold down a job, but if I chose not to take it for a day? Id spend the day in a blacked out room, leaving the bed and seeing the light as little as possible. The adderall made me feel horrible physically, moody, reckless but I was worthless otherwise. My mom was the only one in my family who ever knew any of this and knew that I was always a much, much different kind of little girl. It was s problem her and I tried to solve together but never could. I am the youngest of three. A sister 12 years my senior and a brother 9 years my senior. They both chose to never do anything significant with their lives. My sister was always a waitress and my brother was a bartender. I was the only one who attended university and built a career (as a writer despite this poorly written post). Its actually very abnormal because my family moved here from Israel when I was still very young because of the better schools. Most Jewish families take education very seriously but my siblings always had zero confidence, ambition, or passion. And my parents were not the type to push. In hindsight, they are like my father. My father retired in his 50s and my mother supported everything and everyone. She still paid my siblings phone bills even though they were nearing 40, lent money to whoever needed it. And and I am sure the financial stress she was under contributed to her early death. When she died, the bills and debt did not stop and someone had to take over. I was the only realistic person to take over and I did. But I was overcome with such incomprehensible depression and grief, I just could not work. And I could not lose my $75k a year job when I suddenly had a family to support. My sister was unemployed at the time and stayed that way for a year and a half following my moms death despite the obvious pressure I was under. My brother had recently had a baby (a year ago) so that was his excuse but he would not have helped regardless.To get to the point, I started getting prescribed oxy 30s by a doctor who ruined my adolescence and is now no longer allowed to practice. He prescribed them to me for carpal tunnel and they numbed me and made me capable of working. I knew I was making the choice to become addicted. I knew Id have to face it eventually, and about 10 months later after losing 15 pounds (I was less than 130 to start with) and when Id gotten to the point where I was spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on more pills, I overdosed after taking 90mg of oxy and 30mg of adderall. Well I had a seizure, I do not know if that is technically an OD. It happened in our driveway and when I came out of it, my father screamed at me for hours, saying things that Ill never fully get over. A month or so later I was prescribed buprenorphine. At first I thought I felt good because I was not going through withdrawals constantly while stressing about finding my next pill but buprenorphine totally changed my life. I felt like a normal person for the first time in my entire life. I was still more of a depressive than your average 20-something girl, still an introvert but I cleaned things, kept my space tidy and organized, I got promotions and raises at work, I had healthier interpersonal relationships, I went to the gym for nearly two hours every day for a year and a half. Two years after (almost to the day) of my momss death, I met the man I am nearly certain I will marry. He knows everything about me and has never once judged me. And for the first time, I know I can be a good partner who will not drag him down into my depression. Hes also on Prozac and is a bit of a depressive himself but it somehow makes us even closer. Hes about 10 years older than me and his wisdom about sadness and depression really help me. And we just love each other in a very pure way. It feels right. I have read everything there is to read about buprenorphine and its use in depression. It breaks my heart that more people cannot access it for this reason and that as long as I take it, I will have the label of an opioid addict, something that reminds me of the darkest period in my life. I recently tried going off and trying Wellbutrin instead. It was a horrible experience. During that 8 weeks I bought Xanax and cocaine (two things Id never had any addiction to or interest in but felt I needed them to work and sleep). My boyfriend saw the change in me and really urged me to say fuck the stigma, I am going to take whatever pill makes me the best version of myselfWhen it comes down to it there are people like me out there. Who knew from the time they were little kids that they were depressed. And they cannot find relief. At some point, although I have never personally had suicidal thoughts, I can see how people feel like giving up. Maybe this post is better for the depression thread, I am not a Reddit pro. Just sharing my experience with a medication that turned me from a train wreck who never felt sober happiness to someone on the precipice of engagement who derives pleasure from painting and reading and running these are things are never thought were possible before buprenorphine. TL;DR: Buprenorphine finally successfully relieved my treatment resistant major depression and has been a literal miracle for me personally even though it took going through hell to get here. After lifelong treatment resistant major depression, Buprenorphine changed my life.",Depression
"why do i feel depressed randomly for no reason? I had this time period like 2 months ago where i would randomly cry for no reason cuz i would miss my ex gf, and even when i would not be thinking about her i would sometimes just start crying. and then it was great for a month and now something happened and it is starting again, tho I am not crying as much mostlly only feeling depressed. It only happens when I am alone tho with no people around to talk around or if I am not doing anything, like when i am overthinking it starts to happen again .

"This will be really long, since i have not opened up to anyone and i want to say everything here, so I do not think anyone would read this. It all started last year, when me and my best friend randomly became friends with a boy from our school, after online classes started. we suddenly got close and were known as a trio and the boy started liking my best friend. he confessed to her after some days, only to get rejected by her since she already had a boyfriend. that pissed him off, and they had a fight and blocked each other everywhere. i was asked to do the same.after some months, in my mathematics class he texts me saying that he wants to be friends with me again, and i unblock him. we became quite close, and somewhere he had begun calling him my best friend. it is not like i minded it, so i went with it. he started going out with a girl during this time, whom he said that he liked a lot, but i knew that he only wanted a girl. this pissed me off a bit, but i did not say anything. we were quite good friends during this time, but the way he treated the girl annoyed me a lot. he went as far as asking another girl for n*des while he was with her, and when asked, he termed it as a joke. despite all this, I was still friends with him.The last straw of their relationship was when the boy forced himself on the girl inspite of her asking him to stop many times. that was it, i was ready to break my friendship with him. i cared about the girl, and i could not be friends with someone like him.this is where the entire problem began.i wrote him messages, saying that I wanted to end our friendship, and i think it was during this period when i started getting manipulated by him. he kept nagging me for forgiveness, and convinced me that he was the victim in that situation and that it was not intentional. i knew that this was wrong, but I think it softened my view for him, a bit. i wanted to hate him, but it was practically impossible for me to do so. so i started talking sh*t about him in group chats and calls where he was not present, so that my friends would think i hate him.somewhere during all this, he was again my self proclaimed best friend, and along the line i lost many friends too, which made him the only support i received in my life. when all my classmates talked sh*t about me, he was my support. or so i thought. i tried getting rid of him from everywhere. blocked him, ignored him, everything. but somehow he still contacts me and i have no idea how. he can go as far as calling my parents to tell them that I am ignoring them and tell them to ask me to unblock him. i hate him, very much, and I have tried countless times to push him out of my life but he keeps coming back. I even faked having a boyfriend, so that he leaves me, but he did not, and said that he would wait for me till i broke up with him. after all this, he keeps saying he loves me, did so for a long time and he is done a lot for me.along the line, i kept getting softened and manipulated by him, and mistook his obsessiveness and toxicity for love and affection towards me. I had a therapist but she kept asking me to focus on my studies and one time i tried opening up to her she shut me up saying this is all just superficial sh*t. somewhere along, i started taking anti depressants, which were of no use since they make me feel numb and devoid of feelings. I cannot talk about this with my parents either, since they love him and think that he is a really good guy. and when i try to talk to them, they ask me to take anti depressants and that they are busy for my bullsh*it.to be honest, I am a very impulsive person. I do everything out of impulse. I cut my lower back length hair short because of impulse. and then i regret everything. my last straw was a similar decision. he said he loved me one day, and with all my tangled feelings of love and hate towards him, i agreed upon dating him. a decision i deeply regret, since it was really my last straw. it was suffocating for me and i just wanted to run away from everything. but i could not break up because that would mean me losing the support of my classmates all together, since he had already manipulated all of them into thinking that he loves me a lot, they would think I am toying with my feelings. i could not do that anymore, so i broke up with him, with my best friend's support. i thought i would finally get rid of him, but he created a lot of drama saying that i toyed with his feelings and everything. and all my classmates called me all sorts of things because of that. he somehow even managed to befriend my best friend too.I am just done with all this. I have run away countless times from home, but i always end up coming back because i have nowhere to go. Recently, I overdosed on anti depressant pills, and currently I am in the hospital. I really thought I would die, but I did not. I do not know what to do, and how to get him out of my life. I am going to get into a college soon, and I just cannot focus on my academics or myself because of all this.

"original post:  surrogate dad and I have a self-deprcating sense of humor. I remembered some joke he made the other night. I was walking by the railroad, and then I laughed about how fucked I am. Do you ever just laugh and then start crying at how fucked you really are? I called and told him I was going to kill myself. He told me he was coming to take me home for good, far from my biological parents. I am in my 20s with college and three jobs.Maybe there is a reason to believe you will be okay.

"So, let me take you back to 1989. I had made a pretty bad decision in joining the USAF, as I ended up as an SP (Security Police, pretty much a patrolman), did not realize my ADHD was still there and only controlled by a lot of caffeine, and depression had been lurking in the background. I was stationed in the UK, and was pretty much miserable. My Sergeant was a full-on asshole, as were his two subordinates. Things came to a head one night while I was guarding an ammo depot. I am sitting in the shack, trying to read through a manual to help me be a better cop (as it was), and that darkness hit me hard. As a Law Enforcement person, I was issued a service revolver. Before I realized it, I had it in my hand, and was putting the barrel in my mouth. I could not feel anything but emptiness and no reason to keep living. Cocking the hammer back, I sat there, and mentally asked for a reason - ANY reason - to not pull the trigger. At that moment, the faces of my family and friends flashed in my head. I realized that killing myself was not going to end my pain; it would create pain to those I cared about. I took the sidearm from my mouth, eased the hammer back, and just broke down crying. I told my C.O. what happened, and was taken off duty and sent for therapy. Not long after, I was discharged (Honorable) and went home. It took me 32 years to finally open up and talk about that night, because I was so bothered that I had come so close to ending my life early. Sure, life has had its up and downs, but I am glad that I chose to live. It has given me an over-developed sense of self-preservation. Yes, I am still dealing with depression and seeing a therapist. There are days when it just feels like everything is shit, but I just push through. &amp;#x200B;***\[MODS: I am hoping that this is within the rules. I just needed to get this posted to keep being able to talk about that moment. Please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit, and if there is one that would be more appropriate. Thank you.\]*** It took 32 years for me to open up about this...",Depression

"Honestly it feels like I am living a hell that was created for me. My father was negligent and never bothered to spend time with me, blaming it on the fact that I looked unapproachable. To this day he still owes my mother 8k in child support. My mother was abused and so, i too was abused both physically and mentally. I remember that when i was young, i did not want to shower because i did not want to get my hair wet, her solution was to put me at risk for hypothermia by keeping in a shower with freezing water. And honestly, to this day I never got over it. I never got over the fact that she never made time for me, meaning that I had to raise myself since I was 10 years old. I never got over her tantrums. Wherever I set her off, she would threaten to knock all of my teeth out. I finally moved out after a really shitty fight that made me feel like that place was not home. The place that I am at now does not feel like home either. I have 3 roommates and the two guys that I live with are such a hassle. The first one will not pick up after their dog and there is always a mess of fur everywhere. He will not even pick up after his dog's poop from outside. The second person believes that if he does not talk about his problems, they will go away eventually. they have resorted to calling me childish and immature because I get frustrated that they cannot pick up after themselves. They do not clean, put their dishes in the dishwasher, cook, etc. Even leaving the lights on all night knowing that it will raise the electrical bill. I honestly feel like maybe I am the one that is causing the problems. I am the one that just does not understand the people around me. But I just do not feel like I can right now. My mom uses me as a punching bag because her mother is passing away, my other grandmother passed away a couple of weeks ago (whom I was much closer to), having to move out, trying to locate my first job, and having to deal with my own constant thoughts...I just cannot anymore. I am trying so hard to give myself a reason to still be here because I want to live most of all. I want to fail in love. I want to grow old. But most of all, I want to try new foods and see so many new things. If I left then I would never get to finish reading my webcomics. I would never get to listen to songs from Colliding with Mars and Unlike Pluto. I would never get to finish any of my favorite games. And I am still here because I recognize that my pain would just transfer over to my family. Just the thought of it all being over, it sounds like such a blissful idea. It makes me feel like I will finally be at peace.I would not have to cry anymore. I would not have to feel hopeless. I would not have to suffer. I finally would not feel so lonely. And I would not have to deal with the fact that I am emotionally fucked up. I wish that I knew how I can make things better. I want things to change but I do not know how or where to start. Because if I have to hold on, I know that sooner or later, I will let go. And when I do, there is no turning back. Every day feels like a burden",Suicidal

I had a new career opportunity that caused so much driving I became more depressed/anxious/suicidal.I had two major surgeries, and I found out through them that I am basically infertile I cannot have my own children.I pushed everyone away it was easier to teach them to live without me than to deal with this stronger heartache as it came.I could not handle knowing that my partner might be the one to find me.As someone posted here before, I am still alive but everyone is moved on from my existence.

"Sometimes I think it would be better if I did not exist. All traces of my existence erased, nobody would suffer or remember me. That would be perfect, bc I do not want to die (or live either) or feel pain but I want to take the weight of living off my back peacefully. Life is not worth all the sadness I feel when I start thinking about how I am miserable. There are times where I am feeling good and think ""Life is good, after all. I want to live like this a little longer, I want to live"", but this happiness does not last forever and I start overthinking againI also feel guilty for not wanting to live bc my family is wonderful and I have everything I want. I do not think I have the right to be sad about my life bc I definitively could be worse. I live normally, I am not really sad or gloomy most of my days, it is just that I am tired and empty. I go to a good school, but now I hate studying, I do not want to study more in college and I do not want to work after that, but I will do it because I have to. If I am going to be forced by life to choose what to do for the rest of it, then so be it. I do not have a career I would like to follow, so I will just pick the one I hate least. Whatever, I am just a lazy mf that does not want to deal with hardshipsI'm young so maybe I will feel better someday. Perhaps one day I will laugh at how I was stupid as a teenager that complained about everything and acted like they were depressed, but until then I will just keep living i guess I am tired of life but I do not want to die",Depression

I have been thinking I am a complete waist of space lately cannot find a job that pays well I have no prospects at all. I do not want to just be another cog in the machine. Am tired of this world and its inequality. I cannot make ends meet debt just keeps mounting up I have to juggle what bills to pay from one month to the next. Am 32 and if I have got another 40 years of this shit to put up with I do not want it. I was also just hanging on from having a mental breakdown so I went and done a long distance walk. I came back and slowly started to become depressed again. I met a woman and even tho I only seen her for 4 weeks I loved her from the moment I saw her dove right in feet first. Total fool that I Am. we had the smallest of fallouts and I have been given a two week break to better myself. But all its done is bring everything I previously thought about myself to the surface again. So the doctor prescribed me Prozac. I really thought it would stop me crying and feeling sorry for myself. But I have reached a point today I have started looking for the best way to end it. How the hell I still feel anything after starting these tablets is beyond me I literally cannot stop crying and am on Prozac I thought this would have numbed my feelings but I have cried since Sunday last week.,Suicidal

"Hello everyone! I just want to put a disclaimer that I am poor right now and I cannot afford therapy or even just the medicine alone.I grew out of wedlock and after a year of marriage, they had annulled their marriage because divorce is impossible here. I am barely hanging on a thread right now despite being currently semi-stable. So, I grew up to be extremely neglected by my parents, having no emotional support and it was really tough because I could not cry in front of my mom as it was considered weak. I would like to say that we are decently close because I came out as gay to her and my family included, but she is not really the type to give any emotional affection especially now that I am older. I have not heard any *I love you*s from both of my parents and they cannot tell me directly how they are feeling and that I have the same situation. We do not communicate at all and I am already 18 so I do not absolutely know what it is like to be loved through affirmations and physical affection. Currently, both of them have their own separate families and I am staying with my mom, but of course, I am living near poverty. It sucks because I have not really felt what family is nor do I feel belonged because most of the time it is forced interactions. My father messaged me that he was sorry, but he is not really because he just happened to know what was happening to me. If he was sorry, then he would have been at the start. there is too many information I could say, but know that I was emotionally neglected by both of my parents because they were too busy, too selfish, and too complacent.Anyway, I just wanted to know if it is normal to feel and say to myself these words while growing up: **I want to die**? It probably started on elementary when I was constantly bullied both physically and emotionally by my classmates and I remember trying to open up to my mother. I downplayed every problem I faced to my mom because she would often say how she is filled with problems, so naturally I had to talk to her in a non-worrying and non-stressful manner. She said to just be strong and fight back, and I did. For many years, I pointed a knife on my chest and wanted to stab myself with it many times at that age. But, I eventually moved on from that because I stood up for myself. It did lessen, but to my female classmate, it got worse.Moving on to 7th grade, I transferred and of course I was again on the center of ridicule with somehow showcasing slightly feminine behaviors. It was stupid, but I was made fun of, though I ignored it because I was better than them. I was intelligent; I was better than most of the kids at my age, however, I knew that I was going to be ridiculed always and such thoughts came back.Moving on to 8th grade where I transferred again because we moved places again, I was in a new environment. A more competitive environment whose friend groups and cliques have already formed and stabilized. I was basically an outcast in a block section of 40 students. I was terrified of crowds, I would often get nervous when conversing to other people, but that was fixed by myself when I joined ROTC for high school. Anyway, with me being an outcast and people avoiding me because they already have their own friends and also me having a quirky personality, I often spent my time alone or trying my best to sit with others. Since, I felt so deprived of friendship and bonds, I subconsciously wrote ""I want to die"" again in a piece of paper because that is what I felt and I never talked about it to my mother, even up until now.9th grade came and I was raped by my uncle. I was scared and scarred, mainly because I thought I was going to contract any virus. I attempted to ask help from my mom, but I downplayed it again to just a dream and mentioned it was vague. I was afraid of putting someone in jail, afraid of what others will think of me, and afraid of what will happen in the future. Up to this day, I am still frightened by the thought and image of him, but I already have moved on from the nightmare. I cried many nights because I still did not have any close friends and I was always called weird. 10th grade was a bit better and more tolerable and I ranked 2nd on the whole batch. This was the time, before I transferred again to 11th grade, I hooked up with someone from Grindr. It was mainly a one-time thing, but then when I reached 11th grade and moved to a more-populated area, I found myself using that app many times to seek comfort, connections, and distractions to my problems. This was the time I recognized my mental health was worsening even more. I attempted to jump off a building twice, but failed. First was I talked myself out of it and the second was I slipped backwards and broke down. Or so I like to tell myself. I made those two scenarios up because that would at least have a more viable scenario for my situation. Truth is, I am scared of pain and being shouted to at. I fear being left out when people come in my life. It is what it is, but I am damaged. I mentioned to my mom I was suicidal, but she also said that she is suicidal and I should deal with my thing.12th grade and graduation came and until now, I realized a lot of things. I know who to blame for damaging and scarring me and I have been trying my best to cope. Again, there were so many scares that I dealt with HIV-scare (I am negative), but when you gain enlightenment, it is just dragging you even more down to the abyss. All the nights I cried and had panic attacks, all the unnecessary self-hate by hooking up and trying to OD myself, and all the negative suicidal thoughts in my head right now are all present in my head clashing.Right now, death is the closest comfort I have because I cannot handle these emotions and thoughts anymore. I feel suffocated, trapped in my own hell. I do not want to be abandoned; I want to be loved and to be hugged, and be said that I matter to the people I care and think about. I think I might just take my life sooner or later. I made a promise to myself to kill myself in two years if I do not find a constant source of happiness and I feel as if things are being faster and now I just want to remove the mountain on my back and finally feel peace through death. I just want to be loved, but it seems comfort and eternal peace is my only option right now. I do not want to be invalidated that those are not my options because (1) I am poor, (2) my parents and I do not communicate about our feelings and experiences, and (3) death is a permanent solution to my permanent problems. I have been suicidal since I was really young",Suicidal

"tw: suicidal thoughts and drug usea couple nights ago, i was on lsd just to have a bit of an exploration and have some fun. my trip was fine for the most part but towards the end of the night, I was just lying in bed, face down into my pillow, and my mind made me feel as if I was dying. it was as if i was given a choice to just pass away and in the (seemingly) final moments, i thought about loved ones and people who loved me and all the happy and good things i had going in life. despite the fact that i knew i had so much to live for, i chose to let go. i think i just went to sleep so i woke up a couple minutes after. instead of feeling relieved that i did not die, i was extremely overwhelmed by the fact that i had chosen to willingly let go, and also by the fact that i did not actually pass away. i just cried for awhile, for multiple reasons. i feel guilty for what happened but i also feel a range of other emotions. i know what i need to do (seek help again) and i wanted to tell my bf and close friends about this but i just could not bear the thought of worrying them about what happened so i came here to vent a bit. tldr; used lsd and confronted the severity of the suicidal thoughts periodically come and go need to vent a bit/hear some thoughts",Depression

"I feel like I have lost my humanity. I feel like an empty she will drifting through space and time, nothing more and nothing less. There is no soul, there is no me...what am I? Am I an amalgamation of chemical components working in unison to produce this thing we call consciousness, or am I something more? The more I live and the more I think, the more I know the former is true. We are chemical systems with an imperative to continue existing forever, every choice, every thought, every reaction was preprogrammed, free will does not exist.Every problem my thinking solves just causes further dilemma. Each dilemma deepens the existential dread. I yearn for love, but love does not exist. Love was a lie, love was a fairytale and a marketing scheme used to exploit the people. Love is a chemical reaction, another preprogrammed reaction that drives us to reproduce, to continue existing forever. No two people love each other forever, the feelings fade and time drives them apart. I have seen it countless times, so why do I expect any different? Why do I still dream? Why do I cling to a lie so urgently? Does this mean there is something more? I wonder, and then I realize there is not. I realize its the same reason I crave intimacy and connection, why we despise being alone, its more biological imperatives instilled within us to increase our chances of survival. We are social creatures, we evolved this way because it was the most effective strategy. I crave for that which I have never had, only because I was wired to crave it in the first place.I think about my estranged relationship with family, I think about how my father will soon die and all we will leave between us is painful memories and regret. I feel a slight sinking inside of me, just for a moment those old emotions rise within me, but just as quickly as they come, they go and again I am left with emptiness. I quickly remember that none of it matters, when he is gone it will be like I never existed in his perspective, for his perspective will seize to exist. The same will soon happen to me. The feelings fade because I remember they do not exist. I remember that they too are just chemical reactions firing off inside my brain. They mean nothing, the emotion is not real. It existed because it was imperative to my survival that I feel love for my parent, just as with every human life. Its funny how I wish I could go back to when I felt human, to when I felt alive. I miss feeling, I miss when life was still a mystery, to those days where I was not a jaded husk. I stared into the abyss and saw only blackness. Those painful days where you wish the pain would leave forever, you soon realize those days were still better than the days you thought you wanted. Careful what you wish for.I wonder, why does life want to live? Why does life fight so hard in a universe where all the odds are stacked against it, where the very intrinsic functions act to destroy it? why does it adapt and arrange itself in way to keep going? Well, maybe its because it does not know any better. Nothing matters, nothing is real",Suicidal

"These past few years have been aggravating, and now I am just logged off of my social media, pretty much where anyone in real life, knows me in some way. ( No ones about my reddit account).I hate social media. All I see are a bunch of stupid posts. Post that think are funny to those people but they are obviously not to me. I get annoyed at everything. I hate small talk, so when someone, whether it is a random person or someone I know, say some stupid shit like ""hey"" or ""how are you"" I just want to throw my fucking phone out the window. I hate it. I hate talking to people. I was not always like this. I never really had friends (a bff, reliable, etc) in my life so I would be kind of open to try and make new friends, but everytime, something about it just makes not want to hang out with them or talk to, and it is not the introverted side talking, it is the annoyance of that person. Just when you think someone is okay, first impression, over a short period of time, I realize that these people are just not my type to talk to, hang out with, etc. I ghost them because I do not want to talk to, what I think are ""pathetic"" people. I have never told anyone about this kind of hatred except for here, so in their perspective, I am a ""chill"" person. I keep everything bottled up. EVERYTHING including grudges that I could remember since the day I learned to walk. No ones cares about me, no one pays attention to me. So out of the blue and without any thought, I am just logging out of my social media, hiding and deleting content. I hate looking and my class graduates having the time of their life. I hate how when I try to explain something to them, they do not get it or get the actual point of it.All I see is a bunch of stupid people. I know if these see what I typed here, they would think less of me. They already think I am a nobody. I was a nobody in high and I am a nobody now. I hate when people say ""If you need someone to talk to I am right here"" because that is what EVERYONE says. When i do manage to talk to someone, it is just stupid advise, stupid talk, surely they do not understand how I am feeling and what I am going through because they say some shit that does not even relate to it. there is not even a point in get some kind of ""therapy"" talking to someone because I think I am too stubborn to listen to so-called ""advice.""I have always been the quiet person, in school, at home, everywhere. So this post just seems more like a rant than a cry for help. It might be just the symptoms from the withdrawals I had from my antidepressants. I take 75mg of venlafaxine, and my pharmacy fucked up my prescription order so I have been off of them for a good few weeks. I finally got back on them about yesterday. it will take some time for me to calm down now, but when I am on this current medication, I still feel aggravated.My first meds were 10mg of Lexapro, then 20mg lex., then 10mg of Prozac, 37.5mg Effexor XR, now 75mg of Effexor.I am for this post. I am sorry for this stupid rant. Surely I am going to regret this later and feel embarrassed, but I just do not let anything out. I bottle up too much shit. it is hard to talk about stupid feelings and such. Ghosting my social media seems like a great start for me, I have hated it for many reasons.Sorry again. I am 21F.

"I do not know where to start this story but I recently turned 18 and I have spent the past two years mostly unhappy and anxious, I hated who I am and where I came from. As my dad died when I was nine years old, I thought during the past two years he died due to a suicide believing he jumped off a building, at-least that was what I was told he fell off a building far away from my house for unknown reasons.I held to this thought for two years and spent countless nights crying through anxiety and panic attacks as well as harming myself to cope. Until I got the courage to ask my mom and new stepdad what has happened with my dad regarding more context on how he died. Turns out my parents were hiding information from me that he died falling off the balcony of my house because the railing tore off while he was leaning on it. I am still not sure if that is the truth, but sense then I have never entered my balcony. These hardships found their way into my daily life where I found it very hard to interact with people sense I was young altho I desperately wanted someone to interact with. This coupled with fact that I am on the autism spectrum did not do me any favors. I was bullied relentlessly in high school for rumors spread by bullies of me being gay (I am bisexual) and awkward. I always went home in a bad mood because of this. Faking sicknesses and throwing up on purpose so I could miss the next school day to avoid my classmates. I spent those days in my room in physical pain because of my panic attacks rather than studying for the classes I missed. I was always jealous of people with many friends and especially partners, because I was in great physical shape and conventionally attractive I just do not know how to interact with people and I thought having someone to love would solve my issues. When COVID-19 hit I no longer could go to the gym which was keeping me together in a sense. All these issues got worse 10 fold and because of that I began going to abandoned buildings near my area looking down and convincing myself to jump like I thought my dad did, and I almost succeeded. As a last resort I decided to open up to one of my three close friends on what I was going through and he helped me regain some sanity, that I was worth something and I should not be ashamed of what I am. All in all I thought I got rid of these thoughts habits and pains more recently, I improved my grades got accepted to a great prestigious college and heading towards the future. Until one of my friends managed to get a partner I congratulated him but got jealous. I began hating myself for being jealous and I am spiraling back down to where I was, in the past few weeks I have already missed a few college assignments, I need help to cope with these emotions, I do not know what to do anymore.

"I have wrestled with being suicidal for a long time now. My life is in shambles and I am disabled physically and with mental health issues to such an extent that I am a burden on several people. I thought therapy would help, and it has...but when I explained my suicide plan for if I should ever decide its time to die to my therapist and he said that he would stick with me and ""be supportive"" regardless of what path I choose and complimented me on having a very responsible and well thought out plan.Now I feel like I have no good reason to exist and that I must be really fucked up if a medical professional, who is supposed to stop people from killing themselves, would ""be supportive"". What does that even mean? Am I misunderstanding what someone could mean by saying they would be supportive of suicide? This is not some super green shrink either. He has over 40 years experience, is considered the best care available locally, and specializes in working with people who have severe mental health issues and physical limitations. He even said that if I was able to go th route of physician assisted suicide he would even come be with me for my final farewell if I wanted him to. Is there a point where you cross a line and suicide becomes understandable or even expected? I feel like I have worn out life's welcome. I fight so hard to hang on and many days just not killing myself is an accomplishment. This feels like a blow, it has leveled me. I am in therapy to try and find reasons and ways to hang on and this just feels like permission and encouragement to let go. Like it is not OK for healthy people to be suicidal but if a disabled person is everyone is all in? My family thinks I should wait till my mom dies (as to not put her through it), find a home for my daughter, and then throw a big farewell party and die before my kid is old enough to remember me. I only have my mom and one friend who are not super supportive of me dieing. One of my aunts even offered to send me on a vacation if I wanted to go somewhere special to do it. it is hard to feel like there is hope or help out there when I express struggling with being suicidal and instead of offering support and assistance to keep living people have opinions and support about the logistics of how, when, and where I should die. Even my therapist says he will be supportive if I choose to kill myself.",Suicidal
"I am a female 18 and I am in depression for almost 4 years. I feel extremely uncomfortable with my parents. they are everything I could ever wish for, but still i feel very unhappy when I am with them. Does anyone feel like this too?I think to myself that I am happy but I somehow feel insignificant to my family and the world. I cannot sleep at night properly and not be happy about anything. I was once admitted in the hospital because of panic and anxiety attack. Also had extreme stress. My parents then told me to stop studying a lot. I always feel like they make a better family without me.My feelings and their rude words that comes out of their mouth unintentionally makes me even more sadder. My head pains too much and I cannot stop crying. I am worth but not to the extent of others in this world.My family is very sweet and happy. My mother is a temperamental person and is always angry. She blames me for not doing anything as she is scared of my elder sister and blaming her and shouting at her will lead to her reciprocating the same. My sister is adamant and very much like - I am what I am I do what I want to...kind of person. She sleeps all day and night and watches movies on her computer lying on the bed. While I study all day to improve my grades. Studying has become a escape route for me. I also started watching other entertainment like k and bl series as I have never been into movies. My whole family just sits and watches movies as everyone in my house are just attached to the tv. My mother still shouts at me for not doing dishes, improper working or just simply for random stuff. She also came to know I watch kpop (does not know I watch bl lol) and started to nag at me. My father is quiet and just asks me to do tasks.. Repeatedly again and again that I get so bored of it and just leave my work to do it. My mother would still shout at me for doing the task. If I mention it was dad who asked me to do so, she would just scold me anyway. My sister will dump all her chores to me too. My mother is very unfair between us too and my sister.Sometimes they would all be in the same room teasing and shaming me while I just fake laugh everything.This is not everything. The thing that pains the most is when they act like nothing happened when others visit our house or something like that. They say I am the best and my sis is equally great and that we study and live great and just like life is perfect is every sense! My sister also likes to cajole and kiss me like a child though I mentioned countless of times that I hate it. She says I am the beautiful person she has ever seen. My mother also agrees to it as she just listens to everything my sis says.The fake mask I wear in front of everyone is starting to pain. I smile at everyone and make everyone laugh till they cry while I am always crying deep inside my heart.I hate that in a place like home, I cannot be myself. I am yet to call it a home, it is always just a house to me. I just want someone to understand and be with me Ps. Just while I was writing this my mom just shouted at me for making tea just for me and not for them. My family...",Depression
My boyfriend found my Reddit account and might honestly be reading this right now. I said a bunch of shitty things only a few days ago because I was really not doing well. That does not excuse my behavior but I really love him and I am worried that he is not ok. I feel like such a shitty person and after I explained a few things to him he said it was ok and he loves me but I am worried hes lying and that he hurt himself. I knew I really was not a good person and when he found out it made me so sad. He was the only person who ever really loved me and I loved back and now he might hate me. If he is not alive today and died last night Ill probably do it tonight. I cannot live without him. I messed up,Suicidal

"Just like the title says. I am a type 1 diabetic so that is why I have insulin. Tonight before I go to bed I am going to give myself the remaining vials of my short-acting stuff all in one sitting putting me into a diabetic coma and killing myself. I have just a little over 500U of humalog to use. There is absolutely no way I am going to survive this. I live alone and no one is expecting to come over and find me. I have a will in place with my family that was done way prior to this, so at least the money I am worth will be going to them. I have no one to depend on me - no children or partners or pets. Just my miserable, pathetic self. I give it about a week or two before people probably notice I am gone. In regards to work, I work as a nurse and I took some PTO prior to this so I have 10 days before I am expected to come back. No one will be the wiser. they will just think I skipped work until the news finally sets in. Honestly, what might be the reason people discover me is the smell. Maybe I should go outside? Idk. Everything is planned out regardless. I can finally be at peace with myself. Goodbye everyone. Fuck everything. I cannot wait to end my miserable existence. If there is a Hell, I hope I burn for all eternity. I deserve it. But it does not really fucking matter does it because I am in hell each and everyday. There is no way anyone can convince me to change my mind. I am only posting this because I want this to be kind of a send off of sorts. I have seen similar people write these and they are almost like online suicide notes (speaking of which, I should probably draft one). I do not know if that is too messed up or not. I am just going to ruin everyone is day. For that I am sorry. Maybe you guys can live a better life than I could. Who knows. No one knows who I am; I am just an anonymous loser. Anyways, I just got back from working nights and I am tired. Going to go to bed and take a nice walk when I wake up in the afternoon. Ill probably read some of what you guys say when I wake up, but please do not try and convince me not to do this. My mind is already made up. Hopefully its nice out so I can at least enjoy the sunshine a final time. And with that, I am out. Bye everyone. I am going to kill myself by overdosing on my insulin tonight.",Suicidal

"This is the third day without eating and drinking. Though' will be enough to die, but I do not feel any pain; or at least, is not like the kind of pain you get from when you are hit or cut yourself, it is more like a cold, as when you are sick, but being more dizzy and tired with high temperature. Sometimes my heart ache and random places from my body, but I am still resisting and thinking, like nothing changed at all. This also made me think, it must be the best possible way to die, but not entirely sure. Will be more painful as the time passes?

"I know I should not care what others think but part of me worries about others using this post against me sometime. I still need to post it though. So wednesday was the anniversary of when my brother died. For some details I guess check out my post on r/PTSD. I am autistic and really struggle to do a lot of things I want to do when they involve just myself. Its a LOT easier when others are involved. I finally was cleaning my room today, FINALLY, and then I found a spider. I had to take work off yesterday and did get some stuff done and then today but now I am hiding on the couch. I tried asking for help but that did not do anything except show me I should be trying to figure it out myself instead of asking. My dad died last month and I am just so tired of going on by myself. I hope a dog is worth fighting for but there is a lot I need to figure out first and I do not know if its going to happen. Not sure what will happen if I have to wait even longer for that. I also have mild versions of many other disabilities and it does not feel like life should be this hard because of that. I am trying to reach out for help but its not enough currently and takes time to get. Plus others have lives that do not involve me and I hate interrupting that so much. But I cannot do it myself either. I would honestly rather not do it than ask for help if possible but that cannot happen for everything so I am stuck being a burden. I am a major fawner, meaning I try to please when possible and make life easier for others. I prefer others offering than me asking and I keep getting frustrated by minor things, especially when something does not go how I want it to. My laptop decided to stop turning on last month as well and I should just get a new battery but its not that easy. My therapist gave me a different one but it is not a gaming laptop and needed to update when I turned it on. TLDR: I am trying, I really am, but its not enough and I really do not want to bother anyone else. I was FINALLY doing better and then a spider ruined it and now I just want to give up. I have already tried asking for help and I am just a bother and need to figure it out for myself. I might ask for help one more time but now there is a chance of other spiders in my room because I have not been able to keep it clean no matter how much I try. I tell myself I need to clean and I just sit there on my phone instead. I am really trying",Suicidal
I have (F16) questioning this for awhile after my most recent productive period. i realized that maybe around a month ago i felt that i genuinely and i mean it nearly cured my social anxiety and was on the brink of recovering from my depression. this period of happiness lasted like at least a week for sure and more. i was soo productive i ran everyday in which i never do and i was even artistic and made a full drawing that i framed later. i felt so good and like i was not going to feel the loneliness of depression but this time sadly ended. i do not know why and i realized that I have felt this way before. prior i had another time period where i was super creative and decorative i decorated a full wall on my room and took time to make this spirited away painting. i was just so artistic but for some reason after i fell into this hole of anger and slept so much and rarely got out of bed. i even ended up destroying and cutting that painting i spent hours on and i broke things in my room.i do not know why i got like that but that sense of irritation/irritability followed me after my most recent high of my depression.i do not know if i should bring this up to my pediatrician or not. i also currently take wellbutrin XL 300mg which worked at first but I have been on it for so long its hard to distinguish if it works well still. questioning if my MDD is actually bipolar disorder,Depression

"I met someone on Hinge about eight months ago and we got along instantly which is extremely rare for me. We could not meet in person at the time due to lockdown restrictions. It started like any online dating relationship starts, with flirting and asking questions and getting to know one another. All of a sudden he stopped showing interest. That really affected my already low self-esteem and I tried my best to talk to him and figure out why he lost interest. I came across as cold and scary, he became very defensive, it got quite bad and I had quite a severe panic attack that took five propanolol to sort out. I blamed myself and he reluctantly came back, he would be even colder and more distant now. No more good mornings or how are yous, no flirting, no questions, nothing. Just very short superficial talks about current events or interests. I tried to ask him in a more direct way why he was behaving like that and it resulted in him ignoring me. I gave up and deleted him off all social media (except the one we used for messaging) and moved on with my life. Two months later he messages me saying how much he misses me and wants to rectify things. Nobody has ever come back for me, it meant a lot. We start talking again, nothing gets rectified he just repeats himself whilst ignoring and not apologizing for how he behaved. But I am just happy he is back so I let it be. We finally meet and it goes somewhat well, he does not flirt but he seems interested again. Fast forward to our 5th date and we sleep together. Afterwards he just goes back to being distant despite always being online. It makes me extremely overwhelmed and I go talk to him. I am ignored until he replies about how he cannot take it anymore and how it is not his fault work was busy. I mentioned how affection or at least signs of interest are and he was having none of it. Ultimately I blamed myself and explained my current family situation as it also affects me to maybe make him understand that I just really needed some support and he ignored me for days. I would avoid messaging him but I would always see him online. I asked him for closure as I did not know what do he replied instantly, said it was a shame as we were so compatible and that if I wanted we could still be friends. When I replied that if we both tried it could work, he ignored me again. The day after I went for a day out on the beach and saw a little stall that does clam chowder which I have never tried before meeting him and it is one of his fav foods, when I got home I messaged him saying that I wanted to take him there to show him something even if just as friends. He ignored me again. The day afterwards (which was yesterday) I had a job interview. I have been trying really hard these past years to finally have my own life. I have been through therapy, medication and regularly study and follow well-being advice. Currently, I live with my mom - who has her own set of mental health problems lately she is been well but at times she becomes awful towards me. Especially if I show emotions, the worst ones are if I cry or seem angry (even if I am not, if she thinks I am then that is an invitation to start a fight) - and my cat - who is dying of lymphoma. I am an immigrant so I do not have many friends here. Most of my friends are from work but lately everybody is too busy for me. So this job interview meant a lot. If I get this, I may very well be able to afford to live in my own place. In the hype of the interview, I made a decision to move on and have a fresh start. New job, then new house, new life. And I was tired of feeling so overwhelmed and weighed down by everything and now being given false hope. So I messaged a final time, stating this could have all been sorted within a day. How it is impossible to form any relationship with someone who simply is not there. I then deleted him off the messaging app we use and his number. He has not attempted to communicate but it is not as if I am expecting it. I do not think I am wrong. I think that if he wanted to this could work. What affects me is why is it that nobody ever wants to at least try to make it work? I am willing to compromise, I have always hyped him up and showed him that he matter to me. Every morning I would wish him a good morning despite knowing I would not receive one back, the same would happen at night. So what is it about me that so damn disgusting that does not even deserve a good morning? I am afraid to cry under my own roof. I have absolutely nobody in this world and the only creature on this planet that somehow loves me is going to die soon. I cannot trust anyone because of the amount of times I have been bullied, rejected, belittled, used, harmed. I have attempted suicide twice before so I know this third time I would not fail, plus three times the charm. The only thing keeping me here is waiting to hear back from the interview and how bitterly disappointing it is that now, after my entire life spent trying to overcome trauma and abuse, when I am finally getting where I want, someone appears and completely kills any crumb of love I had for myself just by not bothering to be there. After a half-ghosted ""relationship"" ended I have been thinking about suicide for the past days",Suicidal

My meds have not helped. I do not hate people around me, I barely hate anything but myself, but I am not really interested in a lot of the people in my life or that I try connecting with. The few that I am are so different from me that it is not something I could maintain. Despite being nonbinary and bi, I regularly feel I am cis and get and pretending. I am in a healthy weight range and people like me, but they are not people I like, and I feel incredibly unhealthy all the time. And the kicker for it all is I am a suicide hotline operator.

"I am a 19y/o girlfor background, i have not had a good relationship with my dad since i can remember, when i was 7 he threatened to strangle me, and our relationship for years has been strained because of several incidents. i also do not have a good relationship with my mum, because as a kid id constantly be yelled at by her, and as i grew older, she yelled less, but always backed my dad when he placed another traumatic event on me. because of trauma that I have experienced, I have developed what my psychologist thinks (and is working on getting me a dx for) is bpd. my dad while i was growing up tended to use violence as a way to make me behave more than any parent i knew - most peoples parents would smack them lightly, but even that stopped around the time they started high school. when i was 14, i was slapped so hard my mouth bled, and when i was 15, i was punched. i was terrified of both my parents growing up.i tend to be very impulsive - i spend excessively, and drink excessively. in august last year, i drank more than half of a bottle of vodka in one night, and tried to kill myself. the police were called, and then the ambulance, and i ended up in hospital on a drip for the night. I am 411 and weigh 40kg, so that was WAY more than i could handle. and on december 30th, 2020, i drank an entire wine bottle, 8.5 drinks, in an hour. again, that was too much for me, and my mum realised i was drunk and came to my room. she told me she was going to call the ambulance on me again, and i told her not to (the last time i went in august was incredibly traumatic, and i cannot hear a siren even now without reliving it). she kept threatening to, so in my state, i jumped down, pushed her onto my bed and choked her. i fucking choked her. not to kill, just to scare her from calling anyone. I am so terribly ashamed of it, and have been for months, and I am fighting not to kill myself. but i do not think i can. I am a horrible person, and i deserve to die. i deserve a painful death.

She decided it best to break up since there was really no way we could make long distance work. I knew it was probably the best option, but it still hurts.I thought I would be able to get over her, but I cannot. it is impossible for me to move on. She is all I can think about, day and night, 24 hours. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat. I have had multiple anxiety attacks, some extreme enough to where I vomited. I cannot function without her.

And honestly I physically cannot handle that coming true. That would be enough right now to push me over the edge.There is nothing I can do to distract myself. Nothing works.

I keep trying to open these doors with different keys in different ways, but its exhausting. Yet, there is one door that only needs to be opened once, and it does not seem to be that heavy. I keep feeling it pull at me when ever I get in a bad mood. A door whose key has always been with me and everyone owns. Most people want to push this key away, pretend its not an option. But its always there, waiting for the day to fulfill its purpose. Because everyone will go through that door one day, whether they are prepared on not. I hate looking at the door, but what I hate more, is the idea that due to me opening none of the doors, I will become nothing and disappoint everyone I care about for the rest of my days. I think that is much worse than me opening the easy door. But Ill keep trying. I just hope I can choose the right door for me, before the one door chooses me.

"Just needed to vent and I honestly cannot say this to anyone IRL. The bar is this coming Tuesday. I have not studied in any capacity. I just could not bring myself to commit. I was barely taking care of myself as it was. And that is the thing, I cannot even say that I want to kick myself or that I regret it. My mental health was literally just so poor that if I actually participated in the study schedule/grind, I feel I would have been worse off for it. For context, this summer is the only time I have gone days without brushing my teeth and struggled to get out of my bed. I have had two major depressive periods in the past and neither time was I at this level of neglect. I wish I would have just signed up for the later date, but that is not what you are suppose to do. You are supposed to graduate and immediately study full-time for 8 weeks. I even started early technically, but I put in one full days worth of work and just...stopped. I said oh after graduation when its official to start is when Ill pick it back up...but I did not. And very early on I already felt like I was so behind. I had people asking me what my progress percentage of my bar prep course was at during graduation (we did not even need to technically start yet!!) and it freaked me out. I basically decided at the beginning of July that I was too behind with only 4 weeks left, so it was not possible and I was going to fail. And I gave up even pretending to schedule studying.Part of the issue is/was covid. I felt like a real law student with real obligations, benefits, and consequences before this. Then we went online for the remainder of my degree program. I instantly lost focus and drive. None of it felt real or worthwhile anymore. I could now BS my way through my classes (school had relaxed grading policies) and when it came time to actually learn for the bar, I was incredibly overwhelmed.And hell even if I studied studied, there was never a guarantee that I would pass, but there is absolutely no chance for me to pass now. I do not care what any of my peers have to say about me not passing because well, I did not actually study, and regardless of that, peer pressure just has not ever been a motivator for me. I wish I did care what they thought in actuality because I am completely lacking motivation. My family is truly supportive and I know already they will not think badly of me. But they have checked in practically everyday. And I lie and say I studied when I did not. I cannot tell my friends because I know they all are studying by the stuff they send me. All this to say, I feel very alone at this time in my life.I cannot back out of the exam now so I am treating it like a practice test as I have heard others suggest.

"[Trigger warning] This is mostly based on the fact that my mom always wanted me and my siblings to go to the curch but I was the most sensitive one.I do not have any friends so I did not talk about it with anybody but my mom but I cannot do that anymore.Three years ago I confessed for the first time that I tought God was evil and they told me to pray for things to change.Three years later I have always been praying with the same feelings and now I cannot even think about God without feeling hatred and despair.When I was a kid my mom always tried to get me to go to the Orthodox curch and fast. Three years ago I was having problems sleeping due to my growth and my mom told me it was because I did not come to the curch with her.I got really scared.Basically being scared was the only reason I believe in God and why I am doing so badly.Now I was scared of more than not sleeping ,I was scared I will go to hell and that God will punish me for the tiniest bad tought.I even got a tic in my mind I say ""forgive me God"",I was not alowed to sleep more than 6 h ,to eat fully or without praying and I prayed more than 1 h and did 50/100 prostrations and reading everyday ,fasted for half a year every year, I slimmed up 20 kilograms and got sick, and after a long period I have had an operation to remove my colecist.I was extremely stressed out everyday, not to make a single sin and do everything right.Now cannot go to curch anymore and I want God to dessapear and to live a paceful life but I fear I cannot.I want this to end, be it depression or anything else.I am hurting myself and cry every single day for the same reason for a year and my mom does not really want me going to a therapist nor to get medicine.Sometimes my family makes fun of me and over all does not care.I do not have any friends and I do not know what I will do with my life.My mom now blames me saying that I was a fool back then but I was just a child and she were so prowd of me back then. She was saying that God had blessed her. I have never seen my mom so happy and proud and now that I am not trying to do everything right she started to scolds me again and I felt so bad.Recently she admited she had mistaken but she still makes so many of those twisted assumptions about me and thinks suffering it is my fault for having a bad temper.All these Years I have been doing whatever her and my father told me (my father was knoun for baing the weirdest and most insufferable one; when I was arownd 13 he told me I may become a slut because I was having impure toughts and that gave me so much suffering for all these years,now he died and my mom still thinks he was a saint but thinking about him is like thinking about hell)All these years I prayed that I will love God and I ended up hating God.I do not really want to make up with God.I tried but things only got worse every timeI cannot help but blame my mom because I always believed in her worlds weather I wanted or not.Even now it is the same.She is very confident and her belief is everything there is for her.She told me everything there is wrong about humans and life and it gave me depression because everything was bad and everyone was wrong. She also believes stuff that hurts me like ""it is the fault of the damn feminists that womans suffer these days working and the families have been destroyed"" and tells me there is no hapiness on earth nor something worthy of your time other than going to heaven.I do not want to go to heaven ,I just want a paceful life.But what can I do and where can I go to escape God?Everything normal people do is a bigger or smaller sin and I cannot stop thinking about all my mom had told me and I believed.Everything comes into my head :how if you are making a mistake God will give you punishments for you to wake up and come to the right path.And if you do not then that is your fault for going to hell where there will be fire 10000 hotter and if you are debauched bugs will eat you alive forever and there is guilt fear and dispair, and crows eating the belly and chest of women whom aborted children forever and ever.What can a therapist do about that though?I do not know if my family is bad, my dad is disinterested but my mom never let me believe that God can be interpreted in any other way,and I am scared to do it.She also thinks that God is all loving but the fear of God is the first love.she will make fun of other people who do not have the same beliefs as her and I hate that.She also thinks that I am genuinely a bad person and that I have to change.I do not think she is ok with me not being perfect, she tells me ""if you behave like that you will end up in a hell hole in life, nobody is going to be good with you"".She wants me to always forgive ,she always tells me a story with a woman who confessed she was getting bitten by her husband and the father told her to keep water in her mouth all day(so she would shut up).She wants me to accept life is trash and be humble and kind no mather what, sometimes she just tells me I do not understand and that is why I feel like this is bad...

"I have severely autistic children. I should not have had kids. It was selfish. Completely. And now, their long term future is going to be awful. Every day is noise. there is no break from the constant hum and screeching. I have gained a massive amount of weight since I had kids. If they are awake I cannot sit down for even a minute. cannot watch a show. Can barely have a conversation. Trying to work with them and teach them anything is a fucking nightmare..I have been homeschooling because of the pandemic and it is pulling teeth. My niece and nephew are a year older than my oldest and watching everything they can do.... The freedom their parents have... The way they can just be part of society has sucked my soul out.Every program for ""autistic"" people is actually for Level 1/Asperger's. We were basically shunned out of a karate place and a haircutting place that said they worked with ""people on the spectrum."" Went to a birthday party one time and the stares and whispers were so much we just left. I would kill myself if not for the kids. But I could not do that to them. So, I guess I just keep...

I want to keep them out until there are vaccines but I feel like I am losing my mind. I have seen how things are going to be when my oldest ages out of school. Supports are so awful. I will have to quit any job I have at the time and be a full time caregiver. And keep doing it until I am basically dead and the state can finally help with a care worker.

"Sorry about the title, just wanted to grab attention I am slowly recovering from depression after so many years of suffering from it. I was in such a dark phase and since I was able to come out of it, I just want to say this to you all (to whoever suffering from a lot of things in life) : I may not understand what you are going through but there is definitely light in the end of the tunnel, provided you are willing to reach there by putting efforts. I believe we all need the push we require to excel what we are capable of in life. there is definitely hope, no matter what situation you are trapped in. I know when you are depressed, you tend to be way too hard on yourself. I have felt hopelessness for the longest time in life and eventually I got way too comfortable in feeling that way and failed to get out of the hell, which indeed ruined my life further. So, please start reflecting on yourself from a different perspective and you will definitely find a way to deal with any situation by nurturing yourself. Talk to someone who would help you get out of whatever situation. Yes, we all need validation and we seek to find people who would say comforting words and it is necessary but not every single time. Sometimes, you need people who would push you to do your best by being honest with you. Never start to pity yourself then you will eventually get too comfortable being that way and it will be very hard to get out of it. Be compassionate with yourself by knowing how you could improve certian attributes to enhance your performance in life and start taking small steps. Remember, to take only small steps in the beginning because since we are depressed, we may easily find the job overwhelming if we set difficult short term goals. Trust me on this because I have been there and have ruined my life enough. there is ALWAYS HOPE!!! START TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF!! Exercising helps a lott!!!!!! I just want to she would some positivity on whoever reading this. Sorry, if I came across as condescending anywhere across the paragraph. LISTEN EVERYBODY!!",Depression

In the most recent year i found my self back in that scary place and bc of that i thought if i burned a bridge if would not hurt as bad of them when i was gone. When i was planning my attempt I noted that i should break up with my then Boyfriend. I was madly in love with him but i had this since of guilt that it would be selfish if i took my life while we were still together bc i was too embarrassed to tell him that i had been feeling like that and i avoided telling him about my depression out entire friendship and relationship. So when we broke up I created a bullshit reason just for the situation to be over and we have not really spoken since the break up happened in february. oh now I feel like if I myself in a better place soon I have been getting therapy I cannot help but feel so guilty I am feeling like I need to apologize because i miss him, not even really as a romantic partner but genuinely as a friend.I just cannot help but feel so selfish because I purposely burn a bridge with someone i loved so much bc i so scared of causing pain by proxy. i want to apologize and tell him the truth but I am scared ill come across as emotionally manipulative.

"I was fully committed to my plan that was going to happen this weekend. First, I was going to say goodbye to my unsuspecting family and go for a walk into the woods, where I was going to gather approximately 20 leaves of *Conium Maculatum* (Poison Hemlock), eat them with a few shots of smuggled vodka or something to that effect, and die within a few hours of respiratory collapse. But now, obviously, I am having second thoughts. I knew that eating hemlock would not be fun and peaceful (but at least its not water hemlock, which kills you way worse), and I even thought that I deserved the pain that it would bring, but now I am scared. Dying from respiratory failure sounds awful. Imagine someone sealing your mouth shut, and then plugging your nostrils. I wanted a way to knock myself out very quickly after eating the leaves so I would not feel anything. Chloroform? Steal horse tranquillisers from the farm on the way to the woods? Seemed too unachievable. And I also had second thoughts because my brain was flooded with things to live for (despite them all being highly romanticised, when in reality I know that my life is shit). And now the stress, shame, anger and everything else that accompanies continuing to live is upon me. I have put off all my work because I thought Id be deadwell now what? I do not exactly have the motivation to catch up with anything, and my family have planned a bunch of outings that I am way too depressed to go on, but I do not want them to know that.

"Hi. I really have not done a post before, so this is my first time. But that being said I am kind of struggling. I have been feeling kind of worthless, but I want to do stuff to help others. My grades are doing terribly, and I am taking five summer classes to try and get more hours and pull up my grades. Also, my parents are living overseas with two of my little brothers, and the other little (21 year old) brother, J, is living with me in the house that my parents are letting us use. I only just started getting migraines this year due to stress. Within the last three weeks, my car is broken down, and I have had to use my parents nice car; I had to quit my job at my next door neighbors house so that I could take care of summer classes; I started falling behind on some of my online class work because I had to take care of the house as my brother now only seems to care about our pets and his job and his video games - we have zero clean dishes left, and low on laundry, and I had to spray for cockroaches as we live in the woods and they decided to come to visit yesterday.The other day I spent about 2.5 hours cleaning the bathroom that he uses if he finally agreed to do the dishes. He did, but its been about a week and they still are not done - because he has not touched them, and has only added to them. I have not been in touch as much with my mom because I have been so crazy busy trying to take care of everything else. J got the Covid vaccine, which would have been fine and I would be thrilled for and proud of him actually doing something good in his life, except he did not tell me he got it until after he got it and it was feeling horribly sick and nauseated. I was trying to take care of him, but then he was talking about how I was not doing enough. The day before yesterday, my brain had a temporary disconnect from reality, due to the amount of stress, where I felt like I was in limbo, and everything was spacey, and nothing felt real. Then I got an asthma attack and a migraine after taking the dog out for a run. Finally I texted my mom to let her know a light version of what is going on, because she is my mom, and you expect your mom to at least be there for you. Yesterday, I tried to do a group chat with my mom talking about what was going on. What happened next was is she blamed it on my stress of school and she just took Js side rather than actually hearing and listening to what I had to say, and saying that I was not being supportive enough towards him, and then I just needed to let everything go and forget about the dishes, and the stress, and my emotional problems and focus on him which, while I understood her reasoning, really hurt and made me feel even more kind of worthless.. I was so frustrated, that I backed out of the group chat and said I needed to leave to finish homework. Insert on the kitchen chair for a bit and cried. And then the fermenting plastic containers of peaches,from bout three or four days ago, that my brother forgot to tell me about but put in plastic bags on the floor (I thought it was just cans of food that he was going to give to our neighbors since that is what he would told me), exploded all over the kitchen floor, creating a very sticky mess that I am going to have to clean up. And I just feel worthless right now, and uncared for, and small, and kind of burdened down right now. I am not trying to burden anybody else with my problems, but I do not know who else to talk to, since no one else is willing to listen. Not sure what to do.",Depression

"Hi, I diagnosed with depression a few years ago and have attempted to commit suicide a few times before and luckily all of them failed. I am still undergo therapy in these challenging times (online) and it seems to get better. I still have suicidal tendencies but the frequency is not as much.I do not have much friends because I have a weird behaviour and some people do not like that I am someone with mental health issue. I like to make jokes to make people happy, when I see people happy, I become happy. But sadly not everyone like my jokes. I do not make any offensive jokes but some of my jokes can be lame at times. For example, that movie was ""Egg""celent !. Some people really do like it and genuinely laugh.I also asked a lot of questions regarding social life and it seems to make some people annoyed and complained about me. The questions I ask are simple questions such as ""Do you think my shirt is alright to go to the event ?"". But people can ask me a lot of question regarding ukulele but no one ever said anything about it ! I once lash out before that why you guys get angry when I ask questions when I answer all of your questions politely. They replied with my questions all the ukulele questions are ""good questions"" and my questions are all ""stupid"" questions.There are cases too where people seen me entering or exiting a mental health facilities and people became uncomfortable with me, saying I am very dangerous. There are times where when I go somewhere in an event. The parents shield their small child away from me . I never heard anyone before and this really make sad at times.I have been with seven groups of friends across five years and all of them end up badly. It is always the game event.

I am 19 (M) Its 6am and I have work soon. I cannot sleep and I have not but this is not like me. I have been up all night with the same thoughts running through my mind you should kill yourself who cares how you feel its not like you are important shut up shut the fuck up and stop being a bitch I do not know what to do anymore. Every day feels the same and nothing gets better. I have felt this way since I was in 7th grade and now its to a point where I genuinely do not think I am worth anything. I feel so broken and lost all I can do is cry and think of how terrible I am. Its every day these thoughts of hating myself run on replay in my mind. I have no emotional support from my family or friends and I cannot afford therapy. This shit hurts so bad and I cannot tell if I am actually depressed or just full of self pity. Oh my god it hurts so much and I cannot get out of this hole. I know I am better than this and can overcome it. If you met me in person you would have no idea I felt this way. This probably sounds the same as every other person who is reached out for help on Reddit but all I think about is how much better off I would be dead and its not how I want to be. Could somebody please help me see the light and how much better things could be. I feel nothing but emotional pain and always hate myself for any small thing I do. I just want to overcome this and not end up taking my own life. I really need someone right now,Depression
"When I do not take my meds, I harm others, I harm myself. Deep down I feel like it is just who I am. A nasty person.

I wanted the easy way out to avoid harming any more people and also avoid being harmed by people.When I got down from the chair to hang, for some reason I just could not kill myself. It was bit of a mess because I could not get back on the chair easily, my legs were shaking too much like I no longer had control on my lower body. I really thought I was going to die and I did not really mind, it was more a case of "" well too bad if I do not get back on that chair in time "".

"How do people deal with loneliness when depressed?I am extroverted and anxiously attached, so going for periods of time without socialising has a big impact on my mood. When I am with my friends, i notice a positive impact on my mood that lingers for a few days afterwards. I know for a lot of people who I know personally, it is the opposite, where they withdraw and do not want to speak with anyone.With it being summer, a lot of my friends are travelling to other cities on the weekends to visit other friends in the UK, or going on mini breaks with their partners. Usually I see them on week nights, but this week both my friends who I was due to see cancelled for various reasons, which has left me alone for the whole week.

"Summary: I felt great but then I called the cops on my friend for sexual assault (some nsfw) which they took extremely seriously and I do not want to go to court. Then my cat died and I am in pain. I think my friend filmed my family in the toilet, there is lots of evidence to suggest he did. My mum told me not to call the police but I am stubborn and ignored her, I thought I was doing the right thing that maybe him being on record would help future victims and that if he has any content uploaded they could find it. The police interviewed me and I told them how he used to send me porn and how I think it might be connected due to the genre. At that the police seemed concerned and went outside to contact the sergeant. They said him sending me porn was another offence they would need to investigate. I panicked and insisted it was not a big deal that I was not bothered it was just a joke, I just thought there may be some connection. They said they need to contact the CID and that this is really serious. I am so scared, I cannot go to court, I have serious anxiety and depressive problems. All I wanted was for them to tell him off basically and put him on record, not this. This has gone way too far. Before the police left the constable told me I was doing the right thing and that I was brave. I do not think I am though, my friend could go to prison because of me! I hate myself so much right now. Later on my mum was driving me home and she told me my cat died. She was hit by a car which killed her instantly. I sobbed the whole way home. My mum kept her in the freezer and I needed to see because I was having a hard time believing it. She was cold and curled up like she was asleep. I sat there stroking her fur and crying. I feel like its my fault. We moved to the city near a busy road and since she kept escaping we decided to let her go outside. I was told I could send her to live with my father but I said no because he was abusive and mistreated her so I thought she would be safer with my mum. I moved away recently and could have brought her over but did not. I said the roads might be busy but I was far away from the road. And now she is dead. Its all my fault. I loved her and I am never going to see her again. And you know what is weird I actually felt really happy a few days ago, like really happy and confident, I was energetic and laughing and dancing about. Turns out that was the day my cat died which I did not know about. The next day is when I called the police because I felt so confident like nothing was going to go wrong. Its like I am not supposed to be happy, like every time I think I am on top of everything a string of things go wrong somehow. I thought about killing myself just to end it all so I do not have to deal with more loss or with going to court. I want to live and I want to be happy but I am so scared and do not think I can do it I really need help right now because everything is going wrong",Depression

I used to take zolpidem but my anxiety was so bad it would not work. This worked but I still slept terribly, waking up every two hours, vivid dreams, drowsy brain, etc.She also gave me an anti psychotic (Abilify). My experience in the past with them has been quite bad. I took quetiapine and one week later I told her I never wanted it again.

After all, if I have nothing to fall back on, then I will just attempt again naturally and one of those will be my last.When I try thinking about actually killing myself, a million thoughts run my mind. What happens after? Where do we go? What will my family think? Especially the uncertainty after death, is keeping me alive. Maybe we reincarnate, and maybe I will end up luckier than this life.

Nothing feels necessary, at least for my life. Even if I had some kind of prophecy to fill, what do I receive, what is the point? Is it the journey, could it be salvation? Because if this is the path they gave me, it better be some heavenly reward.Sometimes I wish I could not have the power to reason, to think. But I think the life of an animal to be even more monotonous and bland than my own. So I am stuck between being able to reason and think about my thoughts, but having a vivid and unique life; and having an almost mindless and empty life. Though that does not mean an animal would care, they just do what they are meant to, survive. Sometimes that is what I wish I can do, like at a flick of a switch. Isolate and live as if I were only living to live and survive, not having to think. Unfortunately, that is not a life society sees to be useful or productive, so I hope to be reborn as an animal of the sea.

Now i want to go back &amp; relive my life to the fullest.I am feeling extremely lonely..Is there any way possible? Why is this happening to me?",Depression

If you knew me you would see me smiling or talking about how hard time working to get through my mental struggles but honestly what is the point? All of the news makes it seem like the literal end of the world will be coming in the next 10 years which means I am going to see my young children go through this and it just breaks my heart and terrifies me on so many levels. Yes I try to live it moment by moment but looking at the world headlines makes me feel like covid never is going to end and the environmental is completely fucked which makes me ask again what is the actual point to all of this?! What is the point of all of this?,Suicidal

"that is it. no matter how much i rest or how much i try to change, I am always tired. not only physically but of everything else, and I am really tired of being myself and being defective and living my life.

I am tired",Suicidal
"I am honestly just really sick of it all. i know people have it worse and honestly that makes me feel worse too. i feel like life's punching bag, i feel like every time i start to get over something it gives me a brand new sob story. its tiring, I have never caught a break and no one seems to be able to tell how horrible things get for me. its not just bad days these things turn into months and years. the worst part about it is that i was not even given a fair playing ground to begin with. no matter how hard i look back i feel like I have always felt different. not in the edgy ""i like sports and hate dresses"" way but in the way where there was something just... off. like no matter how hard i try to be like how I am sure I am supposed to i never feel like everything is quite right. there is always something out of place but it is not tangible so i cannot fix it. even in my most enjoyable and carefree moments there is a slight feeling that holds me back, that I am reminded of right before i have fun. it never goes away and i have no idea what it is. maybe that is just how life feels and I am just crazy and think there is something that is not there. maybe it is just my anxiety or depression like people keep telling me. maybe its just puberty, idk!! it just feels like I am not experiencing life the way others do, and not like in the way where i do not go out or something, but like there is something fundamentally wrong with me. i feel crazy and i do not know why i cannot just live my life like everyone else, why it feels like there is always an extra step for me, like i need to try harder for the same results even if I am technically not doing anything at all. this feels separate from my anxiety and depression but no one else seems to think so. they do not get it because they are not feeling it. my mom is going to arrange yet another meeting with my doctors to figure out what is wrong with me again so i can go on meds again. I am scared they will make me go really crazy like my last ones did but it is whatever because i know going on them would make her feel better for me. i just wish she would get out of my room. you relapse and self harm really bad ONE TIME two months ago suddenly you need to be supervised at all times. they act like i cannot find shit to hurt myself with at school, it is honestly making that seem like a fun option. whatever i just hope i can figure out what is wrong with my brain. thanks for reading all this. :| I am slightly off",Suicidal

"I really do not know where to begin. I am 38 years old and on my second marriage (this will be explained in detail) This marriage also includes a 6 year child (that is not mine by blood but I still claim as my own). I am feeling really down right now and there has not been anything that can lift me up as I keep finding shit that brings me down. I am really trying to find to positive side of things but it just has not been possible. Now, here is a long story of why I just cannot seem to get a break...My first marriage was medicare at first. I honestly did not want to be with her but she won me over and I married her.. We had many years of happiness and life events (buying house, cars, etc). I ended up losing my job and joining the army to make ends meet and try to progress our status in life. I was gone from home for at least a year for training then another 6 months for orders due to premobilization of my unit. Shortly after I was off to iraq for 16 months. Needless to say I was away from my wife and home for quite a long while but I was paying the bills and trying to give her a life she enjoyed.During my mid tour leave I decided to give her a chance to ""come clean"" with any doings that I would have a major problem about (mainly cheating). She said she started smoking weed but that was all... I do not mind weed but I did not want her hobby to interfere with my security clearance so I asked her to stop by the time I got home. Fast forward a while and I found out through her computer that she was sexting another guy, a cop (this will play a part later in the story) and they were sending pictures and videos back and forth along with skyping all dating back to the time I was in Iraq. The first time I found out abou it I told her I wanted a divorce and left our house to live with my friend. She made a Deal with me that she would go through an uncontested divorce if I moved back in and went to marriage counseling. If that did not work out then she would grant me my divorce. Win win for me I thought....One of the conditions of the consousling was I was able to check her phone whenever I wanted to assure myself that no communication was happening with the cop. I did not find any for months. But I decided to put her to a test and see deleted the dude from her Facebook. All while making sure that I could see her text messages even if she deleted them. It was not but hours before I found the first text between them. They were not suppose to be communicating at all and she was trying to hide her tracks by deleting her messages. Then I laid another trap, I left for military stuff for a month or so and decided to ask her for nude pictures. My goal was to see if she sent the pictures to the cop. I got the pictures I asked for, and so did the cop... I immediately started the procedure to divorce this woman... Now on the the part that hurts the most. I found a woman that made me so happy and I found her during the finalization of my divorce. This woman was everything straight from the start. I told her ever single detail of my life and everything between. I even left the military for this woman ( I wanted a family and the military is not conducive to that). She already had a baby but that was fine with me. I fell so in love with this woman I asked her to marry me. We got got married, then tragedy, again.Our young relationship did have quite a strain. We bought new build houses twice within 2 years and then our house was hit with a tornado. We lost a friendship with someone that took us in to live with them, we lived in a hotel for a few months then covid hit and everything locked down. We managed to move into an apartment during this time but it was still difficult. I managed to get t-boned in my truck in which I broke 3 ribs, punctured a lung, and was knocked un conscious. So we had that to deal with. Eventually my new family found its way back into out newest ""tornado"" house. After we worked so hard to get it repaired.Mere months later I found out my wife was sexting with a cop. Keep in mind, this is wife #2 now, doing the same thing as wife #1. We are in marriage counseling now but it does not feel like it is helping. As of late I have been asking her if she is still thinking about this guy and she is flat out lieing about it.Tonight I found it she was upset over the fact that this shitbag found another girlfriend and that she thinks about him everyday and that she 100% knew there was a connection between them.Also, fuck sexlife on Netflix because she feels that while the physical portion of that show did not happen, the mental part did with the cop, I found that out tonight as well so yay me... Life for the last 15 years has been such garbage I wished I died in Iraq. Noone else to talk to...",Depression

I have always been the happy, energetic, social, bubbly person in a group with so many plans for the future.After starting therapy my mood has been going down until I was not able to see any point for living. I look at my old photos and wonder how on earth was I this happy and how was I so excited about life (I was still struggling with bad nightmares)?If you ask me to choose between anything I had dreamt of before and death, I would definitely choose death.I do not want to worry about life, work, family, friends, mortgage, weight, health, aging and all that crappy stuff which keeps getting worse with time.I prefer not to exist.

"I lost my business because I did not want to work with a man who physically hurt me. He messed with my car. He caused legal issues in my life. I fell for more bullshit today which means I am still an easy mark for his cons which makes me paranoid about starting another business. He told me crazy shit about the man I am in love with and everyone wants it to my fault. I lost my job because I fell in love with my boss, and he has a girlfriend who continues to make my life a living Hell. This woman has ruined my life medically, financially, emotionally and worse. I have an ex who filmed me giving her a blowjob to hurt me and the man I am in love with. She convinced my dad to financially cut me off, and worse. She told my coworkers that I am schizophrenic and worse. She may or may not be responsible for 2 cars being totaled. She cyberstalks me and prevents me from getting work done. I have another ex who wants everything I do to be about some symbolic bullshit that means I still love him, which has also made my life a living Hell. My friends think I want to fuck their boyfriends because I fell in love with my boss who has a girlfriend, and she is now convinced them that I love all their boyfriends. Embarrassing moments of my life have been publicized - including pimple popping, showering, masterbating, etc. I just do not want to be made fun of for it. The man I am in love with would not care if I died. I do not know how much of my life is a lie. I do not know if I buried my cat alive because of these people.

"I am M/nearly 22 (because I am born December 1999) (also I am ashamed of my depression because it is unmanly)0 I have been living with depression since 2012 where it got worse every year until 2015 where I had multiple failed suicide attempts (not really manly, I know). After that it now comes in episodes. Sometimes these episodes are extreme (like right now because I have lost a family, people on tumblr spread false information about me, witch hunt me, I am all alone and I am getting doxxed), medium or mild. Also there is my dysphoria and paranoia mixed up in this as well. Before I tell you my whole life story I keep it short: Yes, I have been to a psychologist but it is not possible due to Covid at the moment. And I never had any friends in my life as people rather liked to bully me and physically hurt me (that is why I am glad I am out of school for so many years now) and almost got me killed once by throwing me in front of a bus. Anyways I noticed that my eyesight got worse and worse over the years. Can it be because of depression or because I stay up all night (I am very nocturnal) for years now? I had a sharp crisp eyesight a few years ago where I couldf see details 10m away but now I cannot even Identify faces anymore from one meters. (sorry for using the metric system, I am not american) I am scared to go blind. Additonal Note: My hearing is actually my greatest strenght and the only sense left that is close to superhuman as proven by multiple tests in the past that I took. (I do not like to mention it because it is considered cringe and unnormal and I am very ashamed of it but the hearing thing might be because of my autism.)

"So far, I have been on Effexor ER and Zoloft. I have struggled with depression for nearly 10 years, but am only now seeking help. I have now tried each for 8 months. Effexor helped A LOT, but the side effects and withdrawal were awful. Worse than coke withdrawal. Zoloft is helpful. Does not help as much, but it definitely helps, and maybe a dose increase would help more. Neither of these two seem to fully help. Should this be expected? Do any antidepressants REALLY help in the way you hear about? What med has been YOUR personal savior? And what meds have you tried? I am looking for detailed descriptions of experiences on as many meds as I can based on the description of YOUR PERSONAL depression experience. I understand everyone is different, but if our depression is similar, then our meds can also be similar. I want to try a range if meds to find the best one for me.

I am surrounded by suicide and have been for awhile now. i feel trapped. its not that my parents do not care but when they walk into my room and I am clearly upset and they ask what is wrong i tell them i do not know. because i do not know why I am crying or even why I am sad. they do not believe me, so i always have to make up an excuse. recently my mom asked me if i was depressed and i feel like that was my time to ask for help but i do not want to admit that I am actually struggling with it. i told her i was just lazy. i do not have anything to tell a therapist as to why I am sad but do you think i should seek help anyway? should i seek help",Depression

Typical ""manly-man"" type of stuff that I was raised to internalize as markers of my self worth. But man, if there is anything I want in this world, it is to be cared about. I want to be loved, and I am sure I have someone in my life that does but if so they do not really show it... I have a bunch of surface-level friendships with people I cannot just text and talk to or ask to hang out. I have one friend but she is now in a relationship, with a guy that I have become great friends with in recent times, and out of respect for him and their relationship I try not to vent to her as much anymore like we mutually used to, plus I feel like a bother. I am no softy but I wish I had someone that I could just be vulnerable around and not only be cared by, but care for. I am moving in about a month anyways so it makes no sense to try and get into a relationship but the new job I am starting will make it very difficult to start a long term relationship. I wish I had a cuddle buddy if anything. Totally non-sexual, uninvolved, but just someone that I can turn on a movie with and snuggle up against. Maybe fall asleep. I feel totally pathetic writing that but it could not be closer to the truth. It seems that all I am really good at is getting angry, being angry, and feeling like an asshole when I know I am anything but. I am 99% sure the reason for this is that my dad is mostly a good guy, that can get REALLY angry, but only when someone is being beyond stupid or inconsiderate. I guess I rationalized this as being mad = being right, and if someone pisses *me* off, out of all people, it must be for a good reason. it is really just me being on a power trip for a short moment because otherwise I feel incompetent at most shit. I think I just like being mad because it gives me some sense of superiority, and also because deep down, I am just secretly a lonely, hurt man who is tired of having to hide his emotions.I guess I will end it off on some good news. I love running. there is countless trails I run on that no one else really goes on, so I just leave my phone at home or in the car, and just go. I feel so free. And at the end of each one, there is always a beautiful view waiting for me, so I take a break and just kind of stare off and appreciate it before heading back home and enjoying my short-lived runners high. I am also pretty good at basketball and enjoy playing it. that is really the only time I am happy most days, otherwise it is just constantly checking my phone to no new texts, and playing video games and patiently waiting to head to bed just to not sleep.

"In hindsight, I realize that quite a bit of my brain is broken. They should be teaching mental health issues as a spectrum of disorders, build a self awareness in society around mental health problems to tackle stigma, and democratize mental healthcare.We have created an academic medical industrial complex around mental health - all staffed by expensive shrinks - and the huge social gap is instead filled with religion, superstition, charlatans, substance abuse, and worse.Mental healthcare is a basic human right.The Vulcans were right in how they conquered their minds.

I am happy I finally got the help I needed since I have been dealing with this for majority of my life however, after two weeks of seeing my therapist she told me I was emotionally abused by my mother. I always had a feeling I was but I guess it was a shocker to hear it from someone other than my brother. Now my therapist wants me to write about my childhood and everything I remember about it.

All desire that I have is squashed almost immediately by my complete ineptitude, and I have been at the end of my rope for as long as I can remember.

"My s/o was my driving force, but they turned out to be dating me out of pity. They were hiding the fact that they were aromantic from me because they felt bad that I was so excited to be with them. Were still best friends (its hard to break a friendship of almost 3 years), but now I feel like a burden to them. I felt so happy with them. Its the first time I felt loved or cared about. I even received my first compliment on my looks from them. My world came crashing down when I learned this was all hollow and insincere. I cannot begin to tell you how happy I was when they said I love you too. Now its the opposite because they just did that to make me feel appreciated. The first compliment I received in my life on my looks turned out to be the same story. I was so ecstatic to hear that I am pretty, but that feeling is gone since that was just a hollow compliment that meant nothing. I finally started to feel good about my looks after they told me I am pretty, but now I do not even want to post my face anymore. I feel like a burden to them now. This made my mental state go to shit, and now they have to deal with me like that. I still love chatting and calling with them even though I cry every time I do. they are the only thing keeping me going right now. they are still my driving force. Without them, I cannot say Id be alive right now.note: Please do not get mad at them for not telling me about being aromantic. They feel like absolute shit for not telling me in the first place and profusely apologized. They also were in major denial when they noticed they were aromantic and saw our relationship as a way to try and be normal (being aro is completely normal and okay by the way). They soon started to feel sick for not telling me this and felt terrible after noticing they should not of forced a relationship on themself.

"Idk what is this situation but I could not find any relevant area to post it. My father is an abuser. He abuses my mother all the time, I am watching him from childhood, beating her. When I was kid he used to bit me too with belt, chair whatever he used to get in hand. He always suspected that everyone is planning something against him, but when my mom comforted him, he took that also in a negative way and blamed her for no reason. Because of his attitude nobody likes to talk to him, many people tried but he is always so cynical about everything.I went to college in a different state. For 5 years I have not seen those problems, and I was feeling better little by little. I was exploring new things, studying, thinking about solutions to different problems. I was kind of happy. But from age 14 I always have this angry feeling, it comes out when I am alone in a room. It feels like my whole body is burning and I always mitigate this by punching in the air, as if I am beating someone brutally and it goes on for 15-30 mins kind of imagine it like flash pictures, happens mainly in the night before I sleep. I become all sweaty and breathe like a dog. When I do not do it like 2-5 days my thoughts get very clouded, I get angry easily, but if I have done this the previous night I feel very calm. Now I have staying at my home preparing for my upcoming exam, and almost everyday I see my parents fighting and at night I picture I am punching my dad. The next day when I woke up I feel terrible as if I would be happy if I was dead. Idk what is happening, this rage thing is it normal? Currently almost 2 weeks I am having that feeling more intensely and repeatedly. I have stopped watching or reading anything related to gore or ghost. But still I see dreams about someone chasing me and that person does not have any head. I tried meditation but nor worked.

I felt a genuine sense of progression and growth. Today, everything came back and hit me like a freight train. I did not land that job, as soon as that news entered my headspace, it seems like all effect of the meds dissipated. That shit must have been a fucking placebo because now I feel just like I used to 2 months ago. I am so scared for the future. I fear there is only greater deals of pain and suffering to come for humanity, we clearly do not care enough about each other, and those in power actively despise the rest of us. They would gladly watch us slowly rot to death than let us have anything more than mere breadcrumbs. I have no hope that things will ever change for the better. I am so lonely, I just want to love and be loved. I just want somebody to care and to care for, to hug, and to cuddle with and look up at the night sky, or watch the sunset and feel at least a temporary sense of peace, love, and safety in this traumatizing world. I do not know how much longer I can keep getting up out of bed everyday when I cannot stand existing. Sleep is the highlight of my life at this point. I wish I could stay asleep forever. And maybe wake up in a perpetual dream world of being in bed with my soul mate, laying there watching the sunset on our own little private hideaway.I am not sure what venting here will do, venting has not really helped much in the past.

"Tomorrow's my last shift at a job that had become nothing but a source of anger, frustration, and toxic energy that turned me into a person I do not want to be anymore. I recently went on a family trip and I was actively angry that I had to go back to working there when I got back. A week later I put in my notice. No regrets on getting out of a situation that made me feel like I was going through the motions, like I was just a character in a video game playing out my script until clocking out, like my input or ideas or suggestions were not listened to or ""I agree with you but (other person) said no"".No regrets, that is, other than leaving when I had nothing else lined up after. Now it feels like the only jobs I will ever be able to get are things that I will end up hating just as much. And the career path I would like to pursue is impractical, untenable, unrealistic, and I should just stop fooling myself into thinking it is possible, so I might as well just accept that I am never going to be happy in what I do for a living.I had been telling myself that I needed to get the 900-pound gorilla off my back before I could move on in a healthy way. Nope, you just could not put up with a standard retail job. Get over yourself, your dreams are pointless, just give up now, and put the customer service voice back on.I would been telling myself ""do not leave a job unless you have another job"". Yeah, and you did not ever look for other jobs while you were working because you were too stressed out and exhausted (or more realistically lazy and like to complain) from your current job that thinking about work became the last thing you wanted to do so you would just wallow in it. And now that you are at the exit ramp, you still have nothing to show for it. Why? Because you are fucking lazy and you need to accept the fact that this is all you are ever going to be. Just give up and get back to work.I would been telling myself ""work yourself out of a job so they will either have to promote you or you go somewhere else and do the next step on that ladder"". Even if they did promote you, that just would have kept you stuck there even longer, or if you went somewhere else you would be still doing the same thing you hate. Which is the only thing you are ever going to get paid to do, anyway, so suck it up and put the tags back on.The only thing I have *ever* truly wanted to do with my life, and I mean across all of my years of existence, is to put on a show, make people laugh, and help them forget about their problems for a while. But I am not a good enough actor/writer/comedian/performer/anything to get paid to do that for anyone else, I know I would never succeed trying to start something on my own, and the wild card option I keep toying with is unrealistic (for many reasons), most notably because I am already probably too old to start and I would be even older by the time I was good enough.So I might as well just accept that all I am ever meant to do is suck it up, accept my fate, and go through the motions of living doing something that will never let me be happy.

"It feels like it is time. I have been suicidal the past few weeks and I do not talk to anyone about my deep feelings. I am depressed, and that is never going to go away.

"I dream a lot nowadays.. I dream when I am awake and I dream when I am asleep. I dream when I am working, and when I am doing nothing at all. At first it felt nice.. dreaming all day and night. Forgetting reality and thriving in another world, as another person. There, in those dreams I could be everything I wish I was now.. it was- and is still so welcoming. But slowly- daydream after daydream i forget that it is not real.. I forget that those emotions and people- that this world I created is not real.. Ill see my surroundings change- when I am taking a walk outside all of a sudden I am in a forbidden forest. When i look down to my clothes I am wearing a corset and dress, instead of the jeans and crop top I wear out.. and then Ill whisper words to no one but in my day dream I speak normally and with a friend. Ill wave my hands, and Ill cry and feel every emotion in my bones, as if it were real. Then all of a sudden I am dragged back into reality, my mind still hardwired to that of my daydream and I think things like when I find a dragon or of course! The Bermuda Triangle is where all the mythical creatures hide themselves away from humans! And I forget that it is not real. That in reality that type of magic does not exist. Then I fall into depression again as I remember my life is not like the books I read.. even as a witch who communicates with her gods- the type of magic where you just wave your hands and everything is suddenly clean and put together is not true- that fairies are not real and werewolves and dragons do not exist. I forget to often- what is real and what is not, the lines they blur and i fear I am going crazy. Like I am split between another reality and this one. Escapism has become to much, instead of the great coping mechanism it was- its started to slowly kill me.. is it wrong of me to want to let these daydreams overwhelm me.. is it wrong that I want to stay in them forever.. never waking from them.. I want to let them drag me away, kill me, and overwhelm me.. all because I do not wish to face reality again. My dreams are taking control of my life and I can no longer tell what is reality and what is not",Suicidal
"After sending myself to the ER twice in two weeks because of panic attacks and loosing my therapist I am starting to loose hope. Sleeping on a broken air mattress in a living room to work 9-4 six days a week makes me exhausted. There are hardwood floors and the roommates dog's nails click profusely, waking me up when they walk or sleep kick the floor. My therapist stopped talking to me, it is been eight weeks. I am alone besides cooking in my own prep area in the kitchen, other cooks are around me but we are too busy to talk.

"I am an 18 year old trans guy. I do not think words can appropriately express how much I fucking hate myself. I know I am never going to be a real man, and I am never going to be attractive to anyone but my current partner. Cis guys work out to get ripped and hot. I work out just for my body to remotely resemble that of a man. I know that in order to look like a guy I am going to need thousands of dollars of surgery, including plastic surgery to masculinizar my face. I have been on testosterone for more or less a year and all that is improved is a little bit of hair and a slightly deeper voice. I feel like a mutilated hairy woman. I feel disgusting. I come across gay men in the internet who would never accept me as one of them much less be attracted to me. I feel like a total fraud. Everyone at work respects my pronouns but only because its company policy, not because they see me as a real man. The more testosterone I take, the worse my acne gets, and the more bloated I become, this driving me towards worse self esteem. I know the effort necessary for me to be passable and attractive is so much that I would have to center my life around it and make enormous sacrifices to do so. I also dropped out of high school my senior year. I had a 4.2 weighted gpa, tons of AP classes, countless teachers ready to write me shining letters of recommendation. I was President and founder of my schools film club, I was an activist and a member of many other student clubs and organizations. I was on numerous occasions pulled aside by various teachers to be told I was a favorite student and that I was going places. I was also heavily involved in volunteering and was even appointed to leadership positions within the organization I volunteered with outside of school. I scored 5s on all of my AP tests and was often the only one in my year to do so. This year as my former peers are graduating, I am scrolling through their Instagram pages as I get off a 9 hour shift at my shitty restaurant job. I see that multiple of my peers are attending ivy leagues and other schools of similar ranking. This confirms what I long suspected and longed for - I could have easily been admitted to many of the top schools that my peers got into seeing as I outperformed the vast majority of them both in academics and in extracurricular activities. I really fucked that up. But at the same time I intensely hate all of those people I attended school with and am glad I am not surrounded with the likes of them anymore. Why? Because the majority of them were super privileged neoliberal assholes that ostracized me for being different and only tolerated me because I was smart and over-achieving. To make matters worse I honestly miss a lot of aspects of being a girl. I was always the best dressed in school but I never got verbal attention for it because I was an outsider. Instead people just stared at me as I walked down the halls with high heels and a perfectly curated vintage outfit. I had the perfect female body and a pretty face. Even though I was always uncomfortable and everything felt like a performative sham, I was insulated from the outside world and I felt like I had some value. Now i just feel like a chubby, unattractive, worthless blob. Its disgusting . I was also severely depressed and anorexic before my transition and although the anorexia has since disappeared I almost miss it. Its gotten to the point that my self esteem is so low that I cannot orgasm unless my boyfriend calls me a fag or puts his hand across my mouth (which I ask him to do by the way). Now he sometimes refuses because hes seen the effect it has on me so instead I just imagine it even more degrading in my head. I go through suiCidal episodes where I feel like I truly want to die but later when I calm down I want to try to feel better if not for me then at least for the world. Please help I just want to die",Depression
"In a week I will be gone and this message will be a fragment of who I was. I have to do it, not only because I am in pain but to make sure I never inflict pain again. People say it is selfish but they do not live inside my mind, I am protecting them. They will feel grief, sadness, and confusion. But they will live on and I will eventually be forgotten. I will make sure they know how shitty of a person I really was inside. Now, some people disagree with me, say I am not shitty. They say I am human. Humans make mistakes, humans can be selfish, humans lie, humans act on emotions, humans think messed up things.If these things are true I have no desire to be human. I really hope there is no after life for me because I just want it all to end. Life is not for me. Being human is not for me.

"At one point I was having fun doing these things. Its true that robotics competition taught me useful skills like how to code and build, but I was more obsessed with actually winning than learning. Unfortunately for younger me, school teams coaches were focused on ensuring every student learned something and I never had teammates that were super passionate about winning the competition. In hindsight, Its not like winning really mattered anyway. Now for video games, i do not think playing them is bad until you start playing them to avoid your problems in real life or with the dream to go pro in some esport title. I wish I had realized that before i spent thousands of hours alone in front of the screen honing my skills. I never actually stuck to the same game either, i just played whatever was trending at my school during the time. I suppose I was the best there at competitive, but that is a pretty meaningless title. Compared to the rest of the country I am nothing.I used anime/tv and youtube as a means to escape reality as well. I did not make new friends in high school and would watch stuff for 3-4 hours a day (while maintaining my grades so my parents would not kill me)I tried to be a youtuber/streamer just like every other internet kid but that takes talent and effort over timeI also spent a lot of time trying being a game dev but i lacked the skill. I had a little success trading on steam but i still consider that time wasted because its not a very useful skill.I did manage to lose weight and get in better shape and got into a good computer science program but I have lost my passion for programming and math. Its just become a thing i do at this point. I have started to have binge eating episodes and currently am on medication. It seems to have numbed my feelings. I occasionally feel intense despair and hunger but that is about it, usually i feel nothing.I have been to counseling but i just do not care enough to go anymore, what more can they do than say everyone makes mistakes. you are still so young and can make a ton of friends in college. do not compare yourself to others. What even is a friend anyway? Also do not really have a great relationship with my parents if you have not guessed alreadyI do not have any skills that can get me paid other than programming. I hope i start enjoying it again soon.

I left my previous job because of COVID 19 concerns last Year and having to help family and such. It was my choice to leave but given the pandemic my old job was unable to transfer me to another position. I went through a small phase of depression after I left thinking it was momentary. I started a new job in the same field. Thinking that if I got back in the swing of things I could rid myself of depression and be productive again. Its the complete opposite of what I thought it would be. The people who I work with openly do not like me because of my association with my previous organization. Yes we are all adults and I cannot push off negative comments because I do not care but it makes me miss my old job and the environment and positivity that was there. Its almost been a year now since I started at this new job but I am finding myself crying more and more because I am so depressed from missing my old job. It was a calling and I loved what I did. I keep trying to tell myself to hang in there and it was just a right choice at the wrong time but I am still struggling even though I am doing something similar to what I was doing. I know this all sounds silly but I am trying to decide whether taking the risks to try to go back outweighs any negative backlash I may receive from those I work with. I have never been this upset over something like a job. But its almost been a year trying to open my options and viewpoints and my depression is getting worse. Depressed over an old job?,Depression

"I have never made a post on reddit, but I feel like now is an okay time to tryAs per the title I am 21 years old (male) and I am starting to go bald. I do not want to make this post too long or anything but this really is the last thing I need right now and all of my suicidal thoughts are coming back and I do not know what to do. Growing up I had almost no self esteem, I am barely 5'5"" in a family of tall people and up until last year I was overweight. I have struggled with depression since I was 14 as well, and I let myself go all through high school. I am gay, and still not out of the closet, so I had no reason to want to even try to look nice up until last year.I decided that I was sick of being lonely so I started to work on myself, I got in shape, I bought clothes for the first time in three years or so, and I started to do my hair for once. It was all going great, and I started to feel pretty good about myself. Up until three or four months ago, when my hair started to fall out in droves. I went from having a thick, nice head of hair, to now being at the point that you can pretty much see my scalp no matter how I do my hair. I am devastated. Just when I started to care about myself, and try to get out and meet people, and maybe even start trying to date, this has to happen. I have gone to my doctor and got blood work and all that, and the verdict is it is genetic and just coming on strong. I do not have money for implants, and even if some ointment or whatever works my hair is already so far gone I am afraid it will not ever be the same. I do not want to do this anymore. Every time I start to feel happy or at peace with myself something happens and tears me down to nothing. All I can think about is killing myself now, again. The medicine does not work at all. I have tried a cocktail of anti depressants and this always happens. There is no happy pill, life is always going to suck no matter what my attitude towards it is. It feels like someone is watching me in some Truman show scenario and fucking with aspects of my life to drive me to suicide. I am so alone, and losing my hair is the nail in the coffin. I work construction, do not interact with anyone but my boss, one coworker and my family, and I am unattractive. I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. My teens and 20s were supposed to be the happiest of my life and I have only spent them miserable. I do not want to live another 50-60 years like this.The good moments just have not been worth dealing with all the misery to get to them. I cannot love myself no matter how hard I try, I do not want to hurt myself but I am breaking down so badly right now. I have been banging my stupid head on the walls in my room so hard I have a headache still, I cannot stop thinking about how ugly I am. I keep randomly bursting into tears in my room alone and then calming down and then sobbing again 10 minutes later. This is high school all over again and I do not want this. there is so much else on my mind right now besides the hair but the hair is what is finally pushing me over the edge. I am trying my best to appear normal for my family and not depressed but inside I am a complete wreck and it is only getting worse and worse and worse and worse and I cannot take this anymore Going bald at 21 is the final straw",Suicidal

I sort of do not want to be a dick to anyone, but I also do not want people to use this to their own ignorance.

"I am 16, I have been thinking about ending it all every hour of every day for the last 2 weeks. Usually its very passive and its just in the back of my head but lately it seems to be very in my face? Its very hard to explain but for the most part all I can think about its how or when I am going to end it all. I was raised to be emotionless so I am very secretive about how I am feeling on the inside and show no emotion on the outside so my parents do not even know I am even thinking about killing myself, hell they do not even know I am sad and lonely. I have been mostly socially isolated since I was around 11 due to my parents feeling it was necessary for me to be home schooled due to severe bullying (I was severely injured by a group of older students, so I can kind of see why?) but it was mainly my dads decision with my mom not liking the idea, even though I stated multiple times on how I feel homeschooling is a mistake and will only lead to failure, 4 years later and now it feels like ill never be able to fit into society again, I mean I have completely forgotten how to talk to people. This year I have convinced my mom to put me back in due to my ""dad"" not being as close to the family. But at what cost? All I want now is death, plain and simple. All I know is I am not living past the age of 21, It feels as if I am destined to kill myself, no other ways out I must take my own life to escape this hell. I know even later on in life that if my mother dies its all over for me, so why even give birth to me in the first place?I have argued with my mom about how you should not have children if you are incapable of giving them a good childhood and she usually uses the same bullshit excuse of ""Well I know I could not be a good mom back then so now I will try to be a good mom now"" No, those were meant to be the best years of my life, before I had responsibilities before I was even thinking about the future. For those who are wondering my Mom and Dad divorced pretty young in my life, I mean so early on that I do not even fucking remember them being together. Something about my dad having some mental health issues and being extremely violent but even still they stayed in contact due to them obviously having to ""take care of me and my 2 older siblings"". Now for most of my early years whenever my mother had a problem with how I was acting instead of dealing with it herself she would just drop me off at my fathers house and let him deal with it. Now not to mention that his shitty old house was filled with bugs to the point where I could not sleep and had reoccurring nightmares about small little bugs crawling all over me and I would wake up in a panic. Not to mention he was pretty verbally abusive. Pretty much the average shitty father shebang. There is a lot of what hes said to me and done to me that I never told my mom and kept inside and I still do. I mean for example one of the things hes said to me is ""If you turn out to be some gay disappointment I will crush your fucking skull and I do not care if I go to prison because it will be better then knowing that I raised a shitbag"" Keep in mind I was 11 years old, and well it obviously worked because I am extremely afraid of even being friends with other guys. I have so much pent up sadness and anger that I just simply cannot express due to me not knowing how and being a emotionless person for so long. If I would have known back then that I could have called someone to get me out of this shithole I would have back then but now there is not even much of a point because the damage has already been done.I have never gotten therapy or anything because I never said anything because I was so young I did not understand what any of this meant and since it was so long ago I do not know how to bring up this trauma and all of this other feelings of sadness and guilt with my mother because for 1. How are you meant to bring something like that up to the same person who somewhat caused it, and 2. I would not even know how to bring something like that up because of my outwards image as a emotionless zombie. Which has lead to me seriously hurting myself mentally and psychically by cutting. I mean there is truly 0 hope, victim of obvious child abuse, lacking in education, socially inept there is is no way out I have 0 future. I mean I love my mom, she is changed so much in the last 2 years after she found out what my dad did to my older brother and has cut him out of our lives so I am not mad at her I just cannot trust her. I know I must die soon. I know all its going to take is for one thing to go wrong and then I am done, ill make that impulse decision and kill myself. Honestly my thoughts on death have changed so much since I was young. It went from ""holy shit I do not want to die"" to ""holy shit can someone fucking kill me already?"" I have already tried to overdose on Benadryl off of a impulse decision after a argument with my mom, rushed to hospital blah blah idk why anyone would try to save me but its still funny how my mom still did not question how I would even accidently take that much which just shows that nobody fucking cares. I have already planned how I will kill myself when I am feeling that impulse decision, I will take my belt and hang myself. Due to me being able to take some amount of psychical pain from me cutting myself I am sure I can handle that 2 minutes before I pass out from lack of oxygen. I mean the more and more I think about it the more appealing it sounds. I get to feel nothing! You know how awesome that sounds? I wish I could feel nothing today, unable to think or do just relax. I have not been relaxed in such a long time I would kill just to not feel tense. I do not think I have gotten more then 6 hours of sleep for the last couple of months which is just slowly driving me up the fucking wall. I am becoming more and more easily frustrated at the smallest things, I mean I got mad at not being able to find my razor to hurt myself its gotten so bad. I will fucking end it soon, I have lost the fear of death and now I am somewhat determined to kill myself. If I cannot hang myself then I will endure the pain until I am 21, buy a gun and will not fucking hesitate to blow my brains out the instant I come home that day. Its weird how I am not mad at anyone but myself, I ware my self down on everything. &amp;#x200B;I have been alone for so long, do I even want death? do I want to just escape from the problems? I just want a hug man, I just want someone that i can just fucking hug and cry and tell them all of my problems. I have too much trust issues with my mom to do that and my siblings are all way older then me and I have never been super close to them. I have never been super close to anyone i have never felt loved by someone not even myself what is the fucking point? it just sucks knowing that ill die a nobody fucking loser but its not like i can change it. sucks knowing that ill probably not make it past 2023 but who cares anymore everything becomes irrelevant when you are faced with death. if there is a higher being that decided they were going to give me a shit life then ill be the higher being to fucking take it away. abused early in life and feeling unloved.

"Hope this is allowed if not get rid of it . Just wanted to get something off my chestIm 22 recently graduated from college I found out at half one this morning thst i was rejected for my dream job (througha friend thst got onto the next stsge) . Another rejection to add to the list. I have already been rejected by all the other msjor companies in the field I am graduating into in this country. I am a laughing stock and a waste of space. A let down to my fsmily and all my dead relatives whom I promised that i would make proud. I have not. I cannot put myself through another interview process. How could I? I will be turned down . I know I am good at what I do but nobody can see that. The people who matter do not have faith in me. what is wrong with me? Why am i so useless as a person? As for my personal life? Another stream of rejections. Any time I get close to somebody romantically it takes them about 3 dates for her to realise I am a waste of their time. I am not a horrible person either. Quite the opposite I have been told that too often I am too nice to people. Maybe that is my lack of worth as a person manifesting itself through helping somebody else. I do not hate my life i just hate that I am who I am . I wish I could be anybody else. Somebody of worth. Somebody that is not humiliated every time they do an interview, every time they ask a girl out, everytime they think they are getting somewhere. Why bother? I am a waste of breath and I wish i could change thst but I am too far gone. Before you think my ill feeling towards myself manifests itself in interviews etc it does not i cover it up. And the last time i was told i was not good enough for a job ie todsu it was not even an interview as such but a task. I do not even know why I am posting this. It is not a cry for help, it is not a pity me fest. it is more so a case of needing to get it off my chest. Sorry for being a burden not only to you but onto my fsmily and my wider social circle. I had not seen a man more useless until i looked in the mirror. Have a nice day, i can assure you it will be better than mine I feel completely useless and hopeless. I am a joke of a person . Endless rejections in personal amd work life have made me realise how worthless I am.",Depression

This is not a reflection on you or your parenting but just a reflection on how I see the world as it is right now and I do not like it. I see so much misery and pain. So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it.

Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together. I am getting lost in my hopes and dreams, I cannot see far, but I know I can see, Everything is a blur to me, But I am hoping for some visibility, I thank my God for all I have,that is why I am going to die noble, In not going to die sav,I know I need to grow up,I know I need to learn, But I feel that all of my fears, Will leave me 3rd degree burned.

"for over 2 years now as a straight girl I have been struggling with the realization that the majority of men whether they claim to be straight, bisexual, or gay, enjoy sex with men much more than they enjoy it with women. men nowadays do not show much interest in women at all. most men are far more sexually satisfied by men than women, and i feel like any man who says otherwise is in denial. this has been the because for multiple suicide attempts as i am in a relationship with my boyfriend and am very in love with him but live in terrible fear that he would deep down enjoy being with a man more than with me. i do not know what is wrong with me. i feel so unsexy, undesired, and so sexually unwanted. no one wants women sexually anymore. it hurts so bad. it makes me contemplate suicide every day, like why am i even trying if I will never be enough for any man? it is either that or it is the fact that men do not consider women to be funny, or cool, or worthy of any accomplishments. it makes me so sad. my boyfriend means the absolute world to me, i love him with all of my heart, and I am so attracted to him i have barely even felt sexual attraction to any other guy since I have known him. and to think that maybe i hypothetically am not the best he could get sexually makes me ache. maybe he would be better off if i died and left him to be with some hot guy, as all guys want nowadays. men even prefer femboys over girls now. it is like girls will never be enough. men are not even sexually into women anymore. feeling like shit as a girl, i feel so unwanted in this world.",Suicidal

I was slightly worried that it might not have been a dream, but thought there was no way he would ever do something like that.For some background: He had tried to stick his hands down my pants numerous times one night, doing it successfully once and fondling me. I did not talk to him for a year and told him when I got back in contact with him how much it messed me up, and that if he ever did anything like that again Id never speak to him. He promised me he would not.Today I was messaging him and told him that I got a new girlfriend, and he made a comment saying that he wishes he could have blown me again. I asked him what the fuck he was talking about, and he said nothing I guess... and we conversed a bit more and he said that he sucked my dick when we were both drunk.I genuinely thought it was just a vivid nightmare, but it was not. I feel violated, in shock, devastated, enraged, and a million other emotions I cannot begin to describe. I do not know how to deal with this.

"Tw: Suicidal IdeationLast weekend I met up with my ex who I used to (and still do) love very much. It was great for a day and a half...Then my anxiety started kicking in. I started over analyzing everything he did during the time we spent together. I started to ruminate. And now it feels like all of the progress I have made has gone down the drain. I was not exactly going upwards in the week proceeding the meetup either, but it was not this bad. I am currently on anti-depressants, but I feel like they are not helping right now. I had two panic attacks yesterday, over really stupid stuff that should not matter in the long run since what I was considering were hypotheticals anyway. I also got drunk for the first time tonight, and that felt good. Had some sloppy sex with an FWB, and it was good. And now I feel bad again. Empty.

What if I just stopped caring and drove my car into a pole at 50+ mph?Like, I cannot handle this. I have been in love with him for more than a year after our breakup. These feelings refuse to leave, no matter what I do. I have done talk therapy, I have gotten a new job, I have tried going to college, studying, working myself into the ground, getting enough sleep and exercise, eating healthy.

Oh, and the anti-depressants.These things do help, do not get me wrong, but especially recently I have been feeling like utter crap. And these feelings because guilt, and because me to want to reach out to him, and I know my ex would not push me away, but I do not want to rely on him too much. And talking about these things somehow make it worse... And I feel entirely at a loss for how to express my emotions without annoying, burdening, or causing other people pain. Being in love is getting tiresome. Trying to move on is getting tiresome. Life is getting tiresome. And to be clear... I do not blame my ex for any of this. I reached out to him.

I am a really sensitive and analytical anxious type of person. my social anxiety has put me at a crossroads of wanting to improve and get better but finding that when i try, it never goes in a overall positive direction, or i end up regretting putting myself out there because I am worried i did the wrong thing or people will not like me. to put it to scale, my social anxiety is the type where when i go to the grocery store and people just glance at me, i start to hyperfixate on what they are thinking of me. or when I am squeezing past someone and i say sorry excuse me and they do not really acknowledge me, i start to think they do not like me because of x, y, and z. i do go to therapy but sometimes i find that even when i tell my therapist i want comfort and she gives me the i am proud of you i feel like i cannot tell her the negative, shitty, and depressive thoughts i have because she will not be proud of me or that she will judge me (which even though she has every right to, my anxiety hates when i think people are judging me). i say i am high functioning because i have an internship and i do run multiple clubs and i do try in school &amp; i do force myself to go out with my friends and put on a happy face to not worry them. reaching out to my friends are not an option because during the few times i did tell them about my sadness, i am met with a always here to talk but get declined calls and when i say I am doing bad in person, they never really know what to say, so the conversation ends at I have been feeling bad and a subject change happens. i have no hobbies because if I am not working, I am anxious and stressing and i just want to rest. i do not think I am in the mindset for hobby hunting even if that would be good for me.

I do also remember being punched for being gay at the age of 13 by older men in their 18's, I also remember being raped by 2 cops when I was going home from my office when I was 21, I remember swallowing a lot of pills when I was 7 and tightening a rope around my neck when I was 9. I remember loosing an amazing friend one summer day because I did not feel like seeing him at all, because how could I explain that I was feeling vulnerable for the assaulted I have lived in the past, I remember how my father stop seeing me because I was not man enough and I did not know how to catch a ball with my hands, I remember walking home when I was 8 during a hurricane wanting to be blown away by the gusts of wind and I remember loosing the man I loved that die during a tragedy. A man that always told me how strong I was even though I do not have the physique he used to have, he was muscular, strong and kind as a gentle giant, still he always looked at me when we wake up as I was ""Hercules"" or some hero of the ancient times and he used to say: ""My love I wish someday I could be half as strong as you are"". &amp;#x200B;I want to jump into the abyss or more like just stop holding on to life, but I do not want to die.

And in fact you are right here next to me, trying to reach my broken mended heart. It is silly to think that falling into the abyss will solve anything, but I am loosing my strength I have zero today, my heart is aching and my soul feels heavy and numb.

I have feel so much guilt in my life for being here, for being alive, for being able to breath. While so many people has lost their life due to and illness or an accident or a murderer. So my brothers and sisters out there can any of you help me lit my light because the night is here and I feel my light dimming and dying out, so please anyone out there.Be kind to me and bestow a little of your light so I can traverse this night and not fall into the void.With tears in my eyes, your brother Alex.

"Why the internet just makes you jealous that someone out there is having a better life than you, smarter than you and that you are not special in the grand scheme of things and you are just here because your parents had you and diseases were introduced to control the offspring by emotionally blackmailing the population and your parents by either making your kids sick.&amp;#x200B;You are either slave to religion or science choose your poison.

"You work up the courage and do it. No afterlife, you simply cease to be. You are buried. Your family grieves but eventually move on. Everyone you ever knew and their children and their children live and die. Humanity goes extinct. The Rocky Mountains erode into a flat steppe and the Hawaiian islands sink. The sun swallows the earth and becomes a white dwarf. So on and so on until all the end of the universe. Then the Big Bang happens again. The earth forms again. Dinosaurs live and are rendered extinct.Rome rises and falls. The world goes to war twice. And then you are born again. This has happened an infinite amount of times, there was never a beginning. Time is a circle. You do not retain your memories, in fact everything plays out exactly the same as last time down to the last atom. The time passing in between, though trillions of years, was nothing to you. Your birth the next time around was upon you in a blink. And next time you will find yourself here again, and you will pull the trigger again. The ride never ends.The possibility of this is what keeps me going. If you see yourself as etching the grooves in the gramophone record that will decide your happiness or suffering as it plays on repeat for infinity, it might be best to squeeze all potential for happiness out of it, you will be living it out forever. Or maybe your life was amazing up until this point? In that case maybe ending it now and reliving the time when you had it all might be the logical choice. The choice for how you spend eternity is your own. A thought that might keep some of you going.",Suicidal
I was flirting with this girl on a school trip and she stopped being interested because I was not confident enough. I cannot stop second guessing myself and I hate everything about my life. It hurts so badly and there is no way I have found to make the pain go away. Its starting to affect my actual life (example above) and I cannot do this anymore. I do not know what I did to deserve this. I am literally 15 and have not done anything to seriously hurt anyone and I have been the kindest possible person to everyone I have met.

I want to live, I want to thrive and minister and love others but I want to do it as a man. My life is not worth living the way it is now. But I just fucking HATE the fact that because of my religion I cannot ever do anything. So many people have tried to convince me that the Bible does not condemn transgender people, that you can be trans and Christian. But fuck that, man. there is literally no evidence, its just people cherry picking parts of the Bible to support what they want to do. But at the same time, I wish god would come down from the sky for one second and just tell me, hey, its okay. You can do this. But he will not because that is not what he thinks. I have no choice except to keep living as a woman. And Id rather kill myself.I have a plan to cut myself enough that I bleed to death tomorrow.

"Can I just say how lonely I am but its a huge contradictory because I cannot get along with most people and I am terrible in relationships because of trust issues and jealousy mostly.

I have no friends because I do not know how to talk to people casually and the only friends I ever had were people I drank or did drugs with and now I do not do that anymore. My one and only ex cheated on me with a friend of mine and I did not even see it coming. It was a huge shock to me and I was ""in love"" with her at the time. This was like 5 years ago and I have not been with anyone since and I still think about her and ""miss"" her even tho we do not talk. I take anti depressants but they do not work I am going to and I feel suicidal 50% of the time and I do not see a bright future for me like more loneliness and working for the weekend just to do everything or nothing by myself.

"I have been friends with her since we were pre-teens and we have been friends for 10 years now. I was always the quiet one and she was more sociable and got along well with others and had quite a few other friends but we always stuck together throughout our teens, confiding so much to each other, right through to adulthood.&amp;#x200B;She got married today and we had not seen each other for a few months or messaged much since we have both been busy with assignments but checked in each other at least once a month by text. She introduced me to a college friend of hers at the wedding today and we got along. Everything was fine until they discussed the fact that college friend was sleeping over after the wedding. It was then explained to me and I was invited on the spot which of course I had to decline because I was not prepared at all. (she is staying at her family home for this night.)My heart is broken right now because it makes me sad that she would not ask me to sleep over after her wedding. She would not want her childhood friend, her oldest friend with her on that special moment, even if I was busy, she did not check if I could free up time. I have never been asked to sleep over at all over the years of our friendship.And to be honest, I know that it is my fault for not being nice company. I know that the college friend is so much more enjoyable than I am. she is more chatty and humorous and of course my friend would prefer her. I cannot blame her at all for it. I do not blame her really. it is my fault.Or maybe I gave her the wrong sign by not messaging enough? But really I think it is the former reason. I am going to try to be more enjoyable company and message her more but I do not think I will get over the sleepover thing for a while. &amp;#x200B;I just wanted to vent somewhere because I have been crying for a while. she is my only friend and I never thought that I would begin to lose her.

I have been riding rides all day and I have been eating without purging for two days. I did not want to ride the Simpsons ride (bc I get motion sick and could throw up) so I went off by myself to wait for them. I walked into krustys burgers, sat at a booth upstairs alone, and put my head down. I have been here for an hour. Its a busy day. Many people have walked past me. No one has come up to me. No one sat with me. My friends have not even asked me where I am. They all just let me be alone. Which is fine. I want to be alone so I do not understand why I am thinking about how no one has worried about me. I do not even want to be worried about. It sucks yknow? no matter how hard I try No matter how much I force myself.. I can not be happy. Depression always hits at some part of the day.

I do not know where to start, do you know that feeling you have when you are super attached to a person and everything she/he does affects your mood? Well, I am there. I am fearing for her/him to abandon me, we are just friends but I am not sure when this happened, I just cannot be happy if we are in a bad spot on our relationship. And most of the times there is no ""bad spot"", it is just me destroying myself after over-thinking about a posts, or a bad response from him/her etc. The worst part of this is that the most important person in my life does not really have that same feeling for me. I know I am important to her/him, but not the same way, and it fucking hurts, I do not KNOW WHY. And I cannot make it stop. My life is nothing without him/her, and I am ashamed of myself for that, it is just ridiculous. I am even trying to change my body because maybe he/she will like me more. He/she never told me anything bad about my body, but I feel like I need to do it. My body is not bad tbh, but I want it better, not for me but for him/her.I need some advice, what does people do to end this? it is been a lot of time and I cannot see how to get out of this wheel. At this point I do not have anyone I can talk about this with, that is why I came to Reddit. it is super late here and I cannot sleep, my brain will not stop thinking about that person and how our conversation today was not good, I made him/her felt bad in some way and we did not talk much more.

"Most of my life I was, I believe, neurotypical with very few mental problems if any. That is until the pandemic. Last semester I was in dorms but due to covid they forced everyone to be alone in their room. No room mate, no visitors allowed, and you could not eat inside with others. With it being so cold, that meant you could not really eat outside either. Every day I would take my food from the dining hall back to my room and eat alone infront of my computer. If I hung out with friends I would risk losing my housing and being kicked off campus, so I mostly kept to myself. None of my classes were in person. Less than a month of being there I felt these terrible feelings i had never felt before. I felt deep loneliness and isolation and hopelessness. I felt suicidal for about a week and had multiple nights were I came close to attempting to take my life. After some time, I started to feel better. However throughout the entire semester I still felt traces of that loneliness and sadness. I have since moved home, and even now with family and friends and work to keep me busy, I still have regular multi day episodes where I feel empty inside and I feel like I have nothing to live for.Why is this still lingering with me? Can that one semester really be enough to because changes like that inside my head? Idk if I have depression and I am fairly certain I do not, but I have not tried getting diagnosed because it seems to be more of episodes rather than a constant thing. Can 4 months of isolation break your head?",Depression

"Sorry this is long but I have to get it out.I have a dissociation disorder and I struggle with attachment/abandonment issues. A couple years ago I ended up in the youth psych ward. I got discharged and sent to this place called Woods Homes. It was a residential program for youth who have pretty bad mental health issues. Long story short, I got really attached to a couple of the staff there and sometimes they would leave without saying goodbye. That would always break me but I kept going because my favourite staff (J) was still there. When it came time for me to be discharged J informed me that she was also leaving. That broke my heart in a million pieces. me and her did have a decent goodbye but it still hurt just as bad. AnywaysLast weekend was really rough. My mind was spiralling. I was in such an intense physical, emotional, mental pain. I just wanted it to stop.My mind was just going over things that happened at woods (good and bad) over and over and over. My memories are what hurt me. The good ones hurt the most because it makes me realize I am never going to have that again. I am never going to find another J. Never going to see them again.With all this on my mind I wanted to end it. There was not a point to living without them in my life anymore. So I made a plan. I have attempted before but I have never made a plan. At least not a serious, detailed plan. Basically it was death by cop. I have a BB gun that looks exactly like a real gun with no orange tip. My plan was to go to read my confidential files from woods, go to woods, make a scene, have the cops come, Id say what I wanted to then Id point the gun and walk towards them. Bang.That never happened unfortunately. I ended up breaking down and dissociating. I was on autopilot and I ended up picking up my belt and tightening it around my neck. Even if I wanted to, I could not stop it. I was seeing spots and my vision was fading. Then I heard my cat outside my room. His meow pulled me out of my dissociation enough for me to undo the belt. It stayed around my neck for about 45 mins while I laid back and just sobbed. All of that did not change my mind though. I still wanted to bad to die. But I was too exhausted to do anything about it. After all that I smoked a huge dab and went for a walk still dissociated. I was hearing shit all around me, people walking, loud bangs and people yelling. I was seeing little shadow animals running across the road. But it was 4am and I live in a small town where the streets are absolutely dead at night. Just paranoia I guess. I ended up sitting on the sidewalk and dissociated then fell asleep. I got home around 6:15am. It was really a nightmare I was trapped in. The next day I was very physically sick. Just from the exhaustion and all the emotions I was feeling. could not do anything. I reached out to someone I work with at a life skills program and she graciously changed my appointment to monday. I went and saw her and gave her all my writing. After reading it she recommended I go to the hospital. I went to ER and waited for a day and a half before I got transferred to a short stay crisis stabilization unit. that is where I am currently. Its not helpful. I have been doing the work. I have been making an effort. But the staff do not seem to think that my problem is as big as I say it is. Everytime I have gone to the hospital and tell them what is going on the staff always look at me like really? that is it? Okay then its very frustrating. And usually leads to me making a scene on purpose so that they take me seriously. But then that leads to getting restrained and being put in high observation and getting tackled and getting a needle in your ass so you sleep for two days I have been through all this before and it was just as useless then. The problem is.. when I go home I know I am going to go right back into that state and want to carry out my plan. I feel so lost and hopeless. Not sure what to do anymore.Anyways. Thanks for reading.

"I am 17F, Asian.For my entire childhood my mom has projected her insecurities onto me, a behavior which has manifested into relentless cruelty and emotional torture. She used to hit me a lot ( I still have a scar from when she hurled her keys at my face because I told a friend that she had called me a curse) but stopped when CPS came. She has incessantly berated and demeaned me for over a decade, to a point of viciousness words cannot describe. whether that is trying to force me to kill myself or calling me a worthless fucking idiot or shrieking at me that I am a maniac who everyone thinks should be locked up, the pain she has caused me is indescribable. every single day she terrorizes me with insults, comparisons, belittling, threats and manipulation. and I do not know if I will ever be able to recover from the anguish.but whenever I obey her she is nice to me and acts like a good mother. I know the love is real, albeit conditional, and it will disappear the moment things do not go her way. but I try so so hard to keep her in a good mood because I just need her affection so badly. I hate myself so much for this.my father is more normal but he has bursts of uncontrollable rage when things do not go his way. I try not to think about these times because other times he loves me very much. I would like to emphasize that he is very kind to me usually. But these outbursts include physical assault, smashing stuff, death threats, suicide threats, and really mean comments to me like 'I bet you get orgasms from destroying the family like the sociopath you are'.But that is not very common so I do not want to focus on that. what is more common is his enabling of my moms behavior. he always sat back in silence on his phone whenever my mom was shrieking at me and always pretended it never happened. he never validates my feelings and always jumps to comments like 'nothing will ever satisfy you' and 'your mom does so much for you why are you so ungrateful you bitch'. he always sided with her and her bullshit narrative about the family dynamic (essentially I ruined everyone is happiness). It is so frustrating especially when I am begging and crying for him to intervene but he just tells me to shut up and go away and listen to my mother.anyway yesterday my mom was screaming at me as usual because I had not finished a college essay draft. she said something along the lines of how my dad always tells her how he thinks I should be locked up in a mental institution, how he wishes he had his friends daughters instead of me and how he cannot wait for me to be out of his life. I felt really sad about this for some reason even though they have said things like this to me since I was 9.My dad was driving me back home from a dr appt today when I for some dumbass reason asked him if what he had said was true. he obviously got very defensive and skirted around the question and claimed I was always searching for stuff to be mad about, that I was always blaming my problems on my parents, and he did not know what to do to satisfy me. this really upset me as all I want is a loving peaceful family. I will admit it, I called him a bad father. I was so angry by him invalidating me and making it look like such a simple request was absurd and ungrateful. I hate how they will always see me as overemotional and dramatic and selfish without ever looking inward and recognizing their flaws. well anyway that made him super mad and he basically said that he hated me and my mom, and marrying her was the worst decision of his life, that he had stopped loving her years ago and it was all my fault. He said that the family was not worth resurrecting and the only reason he had not left and/or killed himself was to preserve his reputation. When I got home I went and cried to my mother and told her she was right, that I am a failure, and I begged her to hug me. She hugged and kissed me and I felt so much better. She got impatient pretty fast but I did not care. i just wanted someone to love me. I feel so much self loathing for not being strong enough to withstand a family deprived of love. I hate that i am relinquishing my autonomy and purpose and strength just to feel some love from my parents. it sucks. Idk if this is depression or a coping mechanism or what. I do not know how to keep going on. anyway sorry for rant ty for reading if you got this far Both my parents are incredibly cruel to me but sometimes I am so desperate to fill the void I abandon all my morals and appease them so I can get some affection. I viscerally hate myself for this. Is that depression?",Depression

"I do not know why am I writing this at 4AM in the morning but I really cannot keep it in and I have no one to talk to. Also I do not know if I have any mental disorders because I have never been to a therapist to get diagnosed. So here goes, I do not know what to do anymore.. Today I attended the engagement party of my life long friends ( have been friends for almost 18 years now ) and I am almost 25, do not know if it matters. Anyway, Everybody is having fun; singing and dancing with the couple while I am just sitting there doing nothing. I want to go up there and join them but I cannot for some reason.. at times like these I wish I were dead and it is funny to me how I am willing to die at those moments because I have a huge death anxiety problem going on.. so being driven to the point where I am okay with being dead makes me wonder ... Been like this for 10 years now. I cannot have fun, no matter what. Go to a trip with friends ? Everybody's having fun but guess who is not ? guess who is trying to enjoy his time but cannot ? even though I would be happy but i cannot bring myself to enjoy those times. I am sorry I do not know how to explain, I am probably an Idiot. I just wish I was a normal dude but I guess even that thing is too much to ask for.I even want to lose weight but I cannot even find the discipline to do it, let alone the will. I was not like this before but I was not fine either. The problem just became more apparent I guess ?Guess being called a failure and judged for every decision you do in your life by your father ends up in me actually being a failure and I sadly cannot moveout cuz I am from a country where the culture does not allow that..I am not suicidal, I am convinced that there are a lot of good things and that life is worth living but I just cannot seem to enjoy it right now..I am sorry If this makes someone else sad but I really did not mean it..

"I have set a date for August 4. Simply for the sake of irony, since it is my birthday backwards. I got the helium tank, the plastic tube, the duct tape and the oven bags. Just waiting for the elastic chord that should arrive sometime next week. I have written two letters: one for a friend and one for several other friends. I think I should try to write something to my family, but I do not know what. The only ones in my family I truly love are my dad, my only grandma and one of my aunts. Perhaps one of my grandfathers, but I do not really know him. I do not love my mom, but it would probably break her heart if only my dad got a letter. I just do not have anything to say to her. So perhaps it is better to not write anything at all. My last will and testament is done. I have some laxatives I can take just before, to avoid making a mess. I wish I had some sedatives, but I have read that helium acts quickly. Maybe anxiety will not be that much of an issue.I feel so relieved. So calm. Soon it will all be over. I will not have to deal with being me anymore. Pretty soon I will just be a memory. Later on I will not be anything at all but someone who used to live for a while. I am sad I am going to have to hurt my loved ones. that is the only worry I have right now. I wish there was something I could do to cushion the blow for them. Finally going through with it",Suicidal
"As the title says, I feel defeated. Ready to just end my life and never have to worry about this constant cycle of stress, only to see a glimmer of hope that gets crushed as soon as you think it is safe to reach for it. It genuinely feels like life, for me and people like me, in this society specifically, is only granted to prove that hope truly is not viable and that our lives and our beings are merely stepping stones for the more lucky.I used to genuinely love people. Deeply, unconditionally love people. I still do, but I hate to admit that because it makes me naive and open for hurt. And it extends to most all people, and before I could handle the fact that people are imperfect, that is fine, I can still handle that. I still feel that love for people in my life, even despite terrible low points. I have always been able to forgive, and distance, and move on if wronged. Not wishing bad on those who wronged me. I still do not. But that changed these past few years. I went into a deep depression, and I still have not gotten over past trauma my dysfunctional family inflicted on me. That they still inflict. Because I love them, and I forgive them and recognize what they did was wrong but I still care about them because we are all only human on this planet. there is always a reason and meaning, and people have good in them most of the time. If they do not expand it, I just distance but still wish for them to change and do what is best. So I distance, but the distance does not fix my mental state, or the distrust and pain that plagues me and my current relationships to others. I am secretive. I find that to be my biggest downfall. I never allow myself to be truly open, and I lock away deeply intimate parts of myself and the things I enjoy and love personally. I never share my writing, the things I enjoy most, or my media preferences. Even though it is all harmless, I keep it under wraps, and I know it is due to trauma from my upbringing. I can link it distinctly. Nobody would expect my death, and I know they would not because even my partner has no idea how debilitating my mental health gets. And it makes me angry, I feel burned. I am not able to be myself. I am not able to honestly connect with those in my day to day life. I was forced to hide most everything about me growing up, lest it be suppressed or judged harshly or used to hurt me. And I cannot do it anymore. I have lost so much of myself that I will never find those pieces again, to put myself back together whole. Words are only a temporary distraction before it all comes down to crush me again. And, for that, I know that without the 24/7 distractions of other people and work and hobbies I cannot function. I am not whole on my own, mentally or physically, I feel. My cousin committed suicide 5 years ago and it is like a mirror and some days I envy them. I envy that they escaped, and I hate myself for even being capable of thinking that way. I feel like a hypocrite, for thinking of doing what I have begged and convinced others not to do.I am currently unemployed due to the pandemic. Started taking care of a stray, now I have kittens to take care of as well. I cannot drive due to disability, which makes things harder, I feel too burdening on my partner. So I push myself into freelance work, up keeping everything to a high standard, never taking a break from videos or auditory outlets as I work, always distracting myself. But it is all a distraction, and I am wearing on them when they ask about what is wrong and I open up about my mental health or have anxiety attacks or mental breakdowns.""Why are you like this / Why do you have to be like this?""""I cannot stay in this relationship if you cannot get better.""""Why is something always wrong with you?""""cannot you do this later / Why do you have to do this right now?"" ""What the fuck do you expect me to do / What the fuck is wrong with you now?"" And so I keep it all down, I suppress it, and I feel physically awful all the time. Chronic migraines, I never get a break where my mind is not trying to distract itself or is not in an existential dread or downfall. it is not worth living like this, even as much as I love my pets and partner and family. I do not want to leave them but I feel I have to. I wish it was like the romanticized versions of mental health issues. Where your partner holds you and tells you it will be okay, instead of the reality of your partner getting stressed and cracking every now and then and yelling and making it worse and saying hurtful things that come back around the next time, no matter how hard you try to forget it. When I get like that, being held and told it is going to be okay sounds like something otherworldly and heavenly and amazing. I really want to end it all, especially knowing that I will never have that. I have had that maybe a few times, and only after being torn down, only after the person who has the misfortune of seeing me like that calms down. Even then, they never learn a better way to handle it, or listen to me or care to remember when I try to get out what I need and how to handle the situation (I say what my therapist has told me to tell others, it does not work) because I guess they all forget. it is a cycle of pain, relief at last, and then forget. Then repeat. Constantly. And I am too weak to handle it. there is good reason for me living. I know if I passed many would miss me greatly and my pets would likely be confused or miss me as well. I do not want that to happen, I suppose, but I want to end this constant suffering and that seems like a small price to pay. Though I also do love being sentient and conscious, I love listening and seeing and hearing new things. I love learning, and in this world and universe there is so much to learn, I could spend a lifetime doing so, even though I may not have access to formal higher education I have a phone and access to videos, lectures, news and studies. That might be worth sticking around for, but I only love it so much because it is a distraction from my deeper troubles. So why dwell in it and continue the distraction? Even when I write this stuff, it makes me cry hard because towards the end I realize how much I enjoy life and living, and I realize how hard and near incapable I am of doing so fully. It makes me feel shattered and bleak. Why even write it at all?It feels like I cannot even trust my own brain anymore. I already cannot trust it. Why even go on if I cannot trust my own brain? I just want to be happy like I was before. I feel defeated",Suicidal

"I should say at the outset that I am a survivor of 20 years of suicidal ideation. Please do not accuse me of making light of this subject, I have a right to. (As I believe everyone does, if they do it with love, but that is another story.)My motivations are as follows:1. Expose the ridiculousness that is as inherent in suicide as it is in every action. 2. Replace upsetting brainworms (actual plans) with scenarios which scratch the itch but are also amusing or distracting, or are calming because they are obviously fantasy. I have seen this approach taken, without the above reasoning made explicit, in an old blog I came across once. The only one I can remember is from a standing start, drive your head full-speed at the pavement. It could have been considered a hateful site I guess, but I do not think it came from that place, and I found it hilarious and calming.Please share the most hilarious and fucked up suicide methods that have occurred to you. Ill start with one that recurs to me. I would not wish it on another who never thinks of suicide, but for anyone that does, I hope that it occurs to you in a bad moment, to bring you humour and remind you that you are not alone.So here is my funniest suicide method:Hanging via bungee cord in front of a train. The train hits, and any remains left attached to the stretched rope are comedically pinged back in the opposite direction, disappearing from view near the end of their arc.(I know that this would not work and I know that train drivers deserve better. Realism and empathy with hypothetical characters are not the point here, ok? If its that shit, write a better one and that can be my comedy suicide brainworm) Funny suicide methods?",Suicidal

I met this guy on tinder and he seemed really nice and different than other men. It was too good to be true. He would tell me not to trust other guys because they will just use me. he would tell me he never lies and will always be here for me. Well of course those were just lies to get me to trust him and sleep with him. I always trust the wrong people. Later on after I slept with him he kicked me out in the middle of the night. I asked him why and first he said he was worried my mom would be upset I was out late. His second answer was that his boss was coming over and I had to leave. That made no sense so I knew something was up. He later admitted he has a wife of 3 years and he has blocked me. I feel used and worthless. I am already extremely depressed and I hate myself so much..what hurts most is that he dosen't care at all. I mentioned to him before that I was suicidal and he comepletely ignored it. All this just makes me realize how much of a useless piece of crap I am. For someone to just sleep with me and move on with ease let us me know I am not worth shit. I was so nice to him.

In the end, I feel like I hurt her without meaning to, so I decided I wanted to feel as bad as I made her feel.I have not taken my meds and the depression is real.

"Call me a psychopath but I have been fantasizing of killing my mom and maybe my little brother, calling the cops, and have them kill me.

I really do not want to do that but the thought just keeps coming back to me. I am a 17F so my mind is still young, so could the thoughts be normal? I am a very quiet introvert with only 2 close online friends (I do not have irl friends), and have been bullied a lot.Also, my older brother passed away a few years ago and that really fucked me up.

"(I have not been diagnosed with any depressive disorders but have speculations)Since September last year (2020) I have just minimally replied to my friends that were in another college whilst I was in sixth form. I have just became super antisocial and anxious after a break up in July (2020).Today one of them asked me how I was doing and I decided to reply after ignoring the message for a month. I told them that I was depressed and anxious as hell. Although I was honest, I thought I would feel better but I do not.What is wrong with me?They showed their support, saying they are there if I wanted to talk and when I am ready. I basically feel the same, a little bit uneasy.Too long did not read: after months of isolation from my friends, ignoring messages and minimally replying, I finally replied today - saying I was depressed and anxious lately, I thought something would change like a feeling, feeling better.

"I honestly do not even know where to start. I do not want to dox myself or share my entire life story, so I will try to keep this concise and to the point.In the spring of 2020, I went to rehab. Afterwards, I moved out of state and spent 6 months in sober living. I had originally planned to spend a year and possibly start a whole new life in this new state, but as fate would have it, my dad's health kept getting worse and worse. Trying to be a good son, I moved back home to look after him. I will be forever grateful for being able to spend the last 2 weeks or so of his life with him. He died 2 days before Christmas. I stayed with my dad's brother for about a week, that was not working out. My uncle's oldest son, feeling bad for me, offered to let me stay with him and his wife on the condition that I stayed sober and found a job so that I could pay rent. I ended up staying with them for about 6 months, until I had had enough. One day, I overheard him talking with his brother on the phone bragging about how well I was doing and how hard I was working. here is what killed it for me - he then starts talking about how my parents did not make it easy for me (""they f*cked him up pretty good""), and then he went for the jugular - ""I loved uncle [redacted], God love him, but he was a f*ck up"".Like dude, it is not enough that I am working full time, I am paying you money to stay here, and when I am not busting my hump at my paying job I am cleaning your house, washing dishes, vacuuming, cleaning the yard, doing all the things that you are too lazy to do so you wait for your wife to deal with it. So really, I am doing all these things (FOR FREE) to make her life easier since you will not, and you thank me by disrespecting/insulting my dad who JUST DIED?! Oh hell no. To this day, I still have not confronted him. Instead, I have chosen to forgive him, but I will never forget how that made me feel.In the effort to save face and leave as gracefully as possible, I said thank you both for your hospitality, I will be forever grateful, it is time for me to be my own man and go my own way. That was the end of June. I have been homeless ever since.The little bit of money I have managed to save (not squander away), I have been slowly bleeding away living in hotels. My 2 weeks notice at my job will be up next Friday, after which I will be attending a trade program for 6 weeks. I am in my mid 30's, never finished 4 year college (although I have an Associate's degree), and these last few years I have really been racking my brain trying to figure out what to do with my life. I mean, I am currently working at an auto parts factory making under $12 an hour and have been working 13 hour days for a while now and have literally nothing to show for it. I am sick and tired of breaking myself down day in and day out, a prisoner of the time clock. it is time for me to find something that will pay way better than what I am doing now, something where I can make a good life for myself without breaking my back, something I can see me doing until I retire.I got paid today, and I get paid again on the 6th. Whatever I make between now and the 6th is going to have to last me til I graduate school about halfway through September. I have reached out to friends and family on FB to see if anyone can or is willing to help, hell I would even take a sublease at this point. So far, no luck. Even my own mom asked me if I knew anyone who was looking to rent out a room.About the only possible saving grace I can think of at this point would either be to reach out to my local housing authority and live in section 8 for a while, or to liquidate my stock portfolio and try live off that until I graduate school in September. I would really rather not have to go that route if I can help it because the stock in question is potentially poised to take the f*ck off soon and I would hate to miss out on a possible once in a lifetime opportunity. Normally, my dad would be my 1st consultation regarding such matters, but he is gone and about the only other person I have in this world that I can talk to without fear of judgement is his sister, my beloved aunt who in many ways is more of like a mother than my own flesh and blood.I feel lost, you all. I am broke, depressed, mourning, stressed, burnt out, tired, hurting and I have no idea what to do.TL; DR - I have been homeless since the beginning of this month after leaving my cousin's house because I refused to tolerate any further disrespect. Now, I am trying to make what little money I have last until after I graduate trade school in September. It can only get better from here, right?",Depression

But after the previous \~week with my friend who visited me I am just done really.. With everything.. Now that he has left I have been binge eating and drinking alcohol to get drunk on a daily basis as well.. Streaming is also gone now, and I doubt anyone cares either.. About streaming or me really.. I am just so weak, have so many issues, I am beaten down over and over and I just cannot handle it anymore. I also seem to have some ""PTSD"" now. Anything that feels like a touch including my own clothes at times, or even seeing guys touch girls makes me flinch or freeze up and feel terrible, and I fear guys even more now than before as well, even hearing guys breathe in a certain way now on dramas or movies I watch makes me feel quite unwell.. does not help I am ugly as usual. Got called sir at the store today even though my friends tell me I am pretty.. Right.. Also does not help people keep staring at me like crazy non-stop. My friend confirmed this, so I know it is not just me imagining things.. My age regression stuff does not help either.. Wish I got carded for my age, but I look probably 30s or 40s.. have not been carded since I was like 15.. lmao.. Myriad of other issues, but bringing them up with nurses, doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists does not do anything, or they treat it as if it is a normal thing.. e.g. me mentioning dissociation and I just get applauded for the effort I have done so far based on my own research as usual, sigh.. (I tend to learn a lot on my own whenever I need to help someone, can help someone or face my own issues I need to resolve..) Had to solve a lot of medical issues this way as well, since the entire system here in Denmark has just failed me, or doctors are openly hostile to me because I am a foreigner.. Meds for me also never worked, I tried so many and they all ruined me completely. Only diet and lifestyle ever worked for me in any way, but can be hard to maintain when you fear going outside and when you spiral one day or friends/family make you eat stuff you never eat normally, and then spiral downwards starts.. (I get very easily addicted..)Already been thinking of various methods and where to go or get stuff, even thinking of a suicide note for the past several days.. As much as I want to say I will admit myself like last year (was forced there, though) I will not. It would be extremely traumatic to me (was quite difficult) and make things even worse afterwards.Wish the pain would stop, but it is been lifelong and there is no help because I have been pooped on by so many people growing up, and now I am just broken completely, and things just get more difficult as I get older as well, which does not help.. How long am I supposed to wait.. 50 years to maybe get a tiny bit of longer term happiness..?I keep hoping I can get blackout drunk (almost at least) and end it, but my tummy just refuses to drink that much and I get drunk only.. Wish I had someone who understood me, but they do not exist. They simply do not. Not someone with as many complex issues as me..

"So, I might be in a very unique and different position than probably 100% of the world . Please read it all and you will get it. So about 5 years ago I hit rock bottom. I went literally from being in cloud 9 to severe depression, crazy anxiety, low self esteem( just like an on and off switch) I ditched my career as a musician because of insecurities. Somehow I was able to accomplish ALOT in these 5 years. worked hard to find ways to always stay close to music and got multiple jobs within the executive side of the music industry, But of course, always self conscious because I was not following my passion as a musician/ producer. I had a terrible experience in all those jobs, specially because I got fired from the last two. Something very special happened during my last job. I met my current girlfriend/ love of my life and also a super. Straight up a super star, she is a very respected successful artist. After I got fired from my last job, I had a feeling that little by little I was going to hit another depressive episode, which I did. I already overcame it but all the residues from the past 5 years are still there. - Unmotivated, tired, insecure, scared, uninspired. Almost broke . Etc. here is is something unique, because of the past 5 years + my relationship, I have gotten the confidence and knowledge that I know that I can make it as a creative in the music industry (facts) but like I said, all the residues from the hardships of these past years are hardcore engrained in my soul. I am back at making music but its costing me a lot to be consistent staying motivated and focused. Basically what I want is to train / practice / feel motivated / content / in order to prove myself that I got this and once again feel like I am in cloud 9. Anyone with some knowledge? I want to work hard again but this time for myself and not someone that is paying my bills , I want to keep my ambitions alive and conquer everything I have always wanted to , but this time accompanied by my girl . Please help. Help",Suicidal

"Let me preface this by saying that this is mostly me venting and thinking that I am an attention seeker.I do not know how often it happens but its gotten to the point that I am writing this. I do not know if this is normal not but I am turning 20 in a couple of days and for the past 5-6 years have had on and off bouts of suicidal thoughts. Some worse than others where I seriously plan out and try and figure out the way to commit suicide in a way that would not end up making my parents sad. I do not want to give myself a self-diagnosis so I do not consider myself depressed, just really stupid.Pretty much every night I have existential thoughts about wishing I was never born or wishing my parents and friends hated me so they would not care if I killed myself. I hate writing stuff down or trying to explain myself because of two reasons. First is I think I am an attention seeker meaning I think that I am not actually depressed. I mean In all honesty I should not be. Nothing bad has ever happened to me so I should not be depressed I do not understand why. I hate talking about this because I hate people who self-diagnose and try and get attention and pity from others. The only reason I am posting this is because I am concerned about my mental health because I actually visited a nearby bridge at around 4 am, but gave up because I was scared of my parents being sad. This is my second time writing this.My second reason is my parents. I honestly wish they never had me. They care about me, and I am basically just spitting in their face by having these thoughts. I wish they hated me so I would not care about waiting to kill myself.I would like to know how to bring this up to people if I actually am suicidal. Currently I am hating myself to the extreme because I quit my first job after 3 years and have been leeching off my parents for the last month except for doing chores, and running errands for them. They even give me money for the errands and I do not even pay rent so I feel like a complete scumbag. I am interviewing for a job soon though.I pretty much dropped out of college because I could not even find the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and that led me to being scared to go to classes because I am so behind.Recently I have not found any joy out my hobbies either I just feel empty doing them so I just decided to stop doing them altogether. My interests, and motivation to do anything has just skyrocketed downwards recently so that is fun.Sorry for the incoherent rambling, last question is is this normal to think this way, am I depressed, or am I an attention seeker. I would like to know how to bring this up to people if I am actually suicidal. Am I actually depressed?",Suicidal
"I have struggled with depression and gender dysphoria since I was a child. I tried to kill myself 6 years ago, and I am currently in a deeper and more profound pain than I have ever been in. I have never felt more hopeless than I do in this stage of my life. I know that I absolutely cannot continue this way. it is not sustainable. But what I do not know is if I can find happiness. I am 27 years old, and two years of hrt. I have tried mess, mindfulness, cbt, group therapy, everything. At most it will work for a month or two and then I am back to being locked in a crippling depression. And I am tired of it. I cannot take the near constant pain anymore. I have been cutting off my ties to people. I am ready to end it all, for real this time. No mistakes. Because I absolutely cannot take this level of pain.

I like my mind and I like to think and feed my varied curiosity. Writing seems like the only joy to fulfill these desires. Though, I once tried a job that at least provided physical fulfillment: landscaping. Basically get paid to work out in the sun, be surrounded by nature. I applied landscaping maintenance but they ended up placing me on landscape construction, which is currently out of my capabilities due to such immense heavy lifting. Tried telling HR about this, ended spending an hour with two higher-ups telling me that I should not be disruptive.

I have lost pretty much all of my friends. My boyfriend has just stopped interacting with me and blocked me on everything. I am going into year 11 and I still have no friends at my new school I just feel like a ghost 99% of the time . I have heard at least 11 people at my school saying racist shit. And loads of other stuff. I feel like killing myself but at the same time I do not want stuff to get worse for my siblings because of me. I do not know what to do anymore I am done,Suicidal

"I can ignore how unsatisfied I am most of the time. Can go for walks, try to practice mindfulness, be present in my surroundings, find some transient comfort in the moment. Be grateful for what I have.But all that does is just shovel my feelings of unsatisfaction and self loathing aside. Shove it into a box. Or maybe ite more like building a damn, and occasionally the damn breaks or the reservoir is over-full and everything just floods in. Without flung e into specificd this is *not* where I wanted to be at this point in my life. Worse, I cannot actually imagine my life being any different anymore.I mean, it would be foolish and unrealistic for somebody approaching 40 too imagine they could become a professional athlete. I have no desire to do that, but that is how everything feels to me me. *Every path feels totally unfeasible*. I have no particular goals or interests. So all I can do is plod along, the best I can hope for is a job I do not actively hate.Honestly if somebody said I could press a button to wipe my life from existence without causing others pain it would be hard to not press it. I can easily just shove my negative thoughts aside, but all it means is that' there is a void of feeling. Then occasionally the barrier breaks and I feel very sad.",Depression

Nobody will take you or your problems seriously unless you actually kill urself like.its the same as how traffic engineers will not install a crosswalk until a certain number of pedestrians *die* at a certain location even if its well-traversed. I feel like a lot of the factors that lead me to be suicidal are systemic but nobody cares about suicidal people or people suffering from addictions until we *die*. Sometimes I feel like I need to like you know take one for the team? Maybe somebody will give a fuck about climate change or affordability? or healthcare? or burnout or overwork? or financial instability? Worst part of being suicidal is that nobody really cares if you *do not* do it,Suicidal

"The title is not meant to discourage others, but it is what I feel things have come to in my personal experience with life. I just want to get some stuff of my chest, even though it will not help for long. What better place to do it- than *Reddit*? I do not know, but I will still do it. I do not expect anyone to say the magic words that help, so this is again more for me to unload. However there is a possibility someone can help- so it does not hurt. I also rarely write large amounts of texts like this, so I am sorry for the confusion you might get from the out of order- randomness- etc.. from this text.This is also going to be really long, as I will include many things- both as background and as reason.If you struggle with things yourself, please do not take my text as a sign to be discouraged. I feel terrible when I see others struggle and I wish I could help them. **let us start with a little about me:**My first name is Adrian- the rest will remain anon. I am just about to turn 24 years old, live in Norway and have a stable full time job. I have an apartment, a car and money is not an issue.When most people hear that, they think I have life perfectly under control- that I am more lucky than others. And- to a degree that is true. I have been more lucky than many people in this world- but it is not what I have in my possession that brings me happiness. What brings me down is my social anxiety- combined with depression. I have a *somewhat different* type of social anxiety, but I was still diagnosed with it. I can be in crowds, be it in malls or shopping centers- stores- whatever it might be without an issue. Talking to strangers is not an issue, unless it is random chatting. By that I mean, if I am to pay for what I am buying and have do exchange a few words with the clerk in order to get something from the medical cabinet or something similar I have no issues at all. I think that is because I know what to say, how to respond and all that- it is all been done before enough times where I am comfortable doing it. When it comes to random chat however... it is tough to even do with my family. Primarily because I have nothing to talk about. When I am at work, and my colleagues are having a chat- I never join in because I have no clue how to participate. Even the colleague who is just 1 year older than me seems to have done a million more things and therefor have a lot more to talk about. While I sit there, trying to think of *something* interesting I can mention- but I am completely blank. When I do however get asked about something I do know, it is quite alright- until I make some sort of mistake (like stating a fact, that turned out to be false) I feel like an idiot. I do not show that though- I shrug it off and pretend I found it sort of funny. I live most of my life currently pretending I am happy, like everything is fine. I work at a place I cannot show my depression to others. I imagine most places would be like that however. I am quite good at that now, do not think most people know my life is... bad. **let us go back in time a bit:**Quite early in my life, after changing schools because of moving- I was starting to become a target from bullies. The good old classic. Some people would constantly pick on me, other people pretended to be disgusted when I was nearby- some just ignored me and so on. The school's solution to this was to remove me from class... I thought back then that was great, get me away from those people. I have however come to realize that it was probably a bad solution. I never got to work with other students, never really had a chance to socialize the little bit you can during class. I was alone, with a teacher of my own. I did have a few friends, so that was something- but long story short I messed that up and lost them.This went on until the end of 10th grade. Get bullied, picked on- and have a few nice people that I would stick with until something happened that made them go away. Then high school arrived- and I was excited for a new chance with new people. (and of course I liked the school.) The first few months, I attended school but gained no contacts. No one treated me bad so I did not really mind that.. Until one day where I entered my classroom, 2 girls were standing by the door and laughed when I passed them. Thinking back at it now, I think it was just a coincidence- but back then it dropped my self esteem right back to the ground. 1 of those girls I even found attractive, so that did not help. Then after a little more time things become quite good. I became friends with a few in class, and the rest still treated me quite alright. The only thing that made me feel bad was the thought I still had not had a girlfriend. (This was at the age of 16, quite early to sob about such a thing.). Year 2 of high school, I went the route for car mechanics. I was back at the start of having no contacts, friends or such. I was still treated alright by everyone though. I asked some people if I could join them when they drove to the store to get lunch (some were over 18)- and they said I would be able to join them- it one of the car seats were not taken by a spare wheel. I felt neutral about that, because at least they did not talk down on me or anything. Later that year I made friends again. Great right? Indeed it was, school was fun again. (Fun fact, one of the people in this group was the girl I earlier stated I found attractive.) The only relevant things from the rest of the year is about said girl. She was now a friend- and I did not want to ruin that. So despise people saying she was interested in me I took no chances. So I treated her as a friend, until near Christmas where I finally decided to somewhat casually ask her about going out and do something together. That was the day she just became the girlfriend of someone else in class. I was back at the bottom, but pretended to be happy. Back then I was terrible at pretending and people kept asking why I was down. did not feel it was worth talking about so I walked away. She, and the others though did remain my friends out that year. School year ended, and people from that group started to become somewhat snappy- passive aggressive. So I gave up on them too. I did however remain friends with said girls- boyfriend. Next year, I retake the same year but with another subject. Same procedure, sit alone most of the time at first- then I make 2 friends. We shared interest in gaming so we played online quite a bit. I believe these 2 were the best friends I had made. There is of course a girl in class I found attractive- and she had a difficult personality to understand... I misunderstood her all the time and kept thinking she despised me. That of course did make me feel horrible a lot during that year. At this time, I do believe my main because of depression was things like this. The year ends, and I have to find a job- but I fail. I think I got 1 singular interview during the summer. They did not want me there so I was without a job. Here is where I got lucky, a company calls me and asks me to come in for an interview. I get there, and see the ""attractive girl from last school year"" was also called in for an interview. At this point I do however realize I am not despised and we had neutral opinions of each other. (At least that is what I believe). Both of us get the job (as apprentices), so there is that. During the next 2 years nothing interesting happens, except me constantly feeling horrible about life- and not having a single good experience on apps like Tinder and so on. Before I continue, let us fill out a bit how dating apps have hurt me. By the time I had reached 18, my depression was quite strong. I did honestly feel like people hated me but were nice and hid it. While using the apps, I was often unmatched within the first 5 seconds of matching. That did hurt when it had happened for the 20th time. I never dared to say hi to anyone- so that is my fault I guess. Those who said hi to me first- made me feel good! For about 5 minutes until you could clearly tell in the messages they were uninterested. (Like the saying, talking to a wall.)These apps, did bring me even further down overall. Never up. Back to the real life part. &amp;#x200B;After 2 years you take sort of an exam, and after that you are no longer an apprentice. I scored maximum. (3 points, excellent.) So did the girl I was working with. One of the people I worked with suggested I invited the girl out for a ""celebratory"" dinner for finishing school 100% with a good score. It was worth a shot. She denied that immediately. (This did, once again- destroy me inside, but in the long run it was for the better.) Both of us get's the opportunity to continue working for a partner company as long as the interview goes well. That it did. We both remained colleagues so that is when I realized it was indeed good she said no. About at this time though, I make a incredibly stupid decision to ""reset my social life"". I thought if I could get myself into a completely new social environment I would maybe have a better life in general. I did this because I was still constantly feeling horrible- like people disliked me and such. After this I never made new friends, and 3- soon 4 years later here I am- still alone. I have never found another opportunity even to make new friends, I no longer meet new people. The people I meet at work are a lot older (no offence to them). And those my age still seem to look down on me. That is the big thing with me, I feel like everyone looks down on me- even without proof. The thing is, with social anxiety- is one notices so many details of how one reacts to your presence. Even to details that were never even there. I still am like this... Quite a bit of people have given me suggestions on how to deal with things- I have even tried talking to a psychologist. Nothing worked. When people say good things to be- it goes in one ear, and out the other. When people say rude things, it sticks like glue. I cannot take praises seriously anymore. I cannot take advices. I do not see the worth of anything. All in all, I ***really*** wish I never existed. I have done nothing good to this world. I have been destroyed- I no longer want help. I just want it to be over. The only things that make me feel good, even just for a moment- is random things like a stranger saying something nice. Compliments from people I know, do nothing. I honestly think, the only thing that would get me out of this she will- is a semi-random situation that for example results in me making a new acquaintance. But we all know that is not how the world works, especially for someone who is always at home when he is not at work. Summary: I do not think I can be helped anymore. My mind instantly switches anything positive to the negative. I was recently back at a neutral state, but then I had yet again a negative experience with another person- which brought right back down to the floor. I feel worthless- and all the other negative emotions one tend to feel during depression. This text became a complete mess, I know. There is even a ton of stories I wanted to fit in- but it will just clutter it all up at this point. The results of my depression was, a couple years back I made a deal with myself.I will give life a chance to redeem itself. I have set a date in the future- which I will not share- but it is still several years until. If I still live alone, with no friends- with no sense of purpose- with ***no light in the tunnel*** I am in... I will take my leave. It did in a way help to unload this, but not as much as I had hoped- because it did at the same time bring back couple bad memories of life.. I do not really plan on paying attention to the comments here, but knowing myself I will probably still do it. I would also like to finally point out, that (as mentioned partially in rule 5.) most replies with long explanations that in short just tells you that ""just to this and it all works out"" will not work. I am a very complicated work of machinery (not literally). For those who are just reading- thanks for your time, and if you are struggling with something I do truly hope you figure it out.. I know how it is... I just cannot figure out my issues. Not everyone can be helped",Depression

"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t",Depression

If I am suffering and everyone else around me is suffering due to my mental illness than this must be selfish. I take and I cannot ever give back. Even when I think I am doing better, I am not. Even if I think I am okay I am just being selfish towards someone else. I am too much of a pussy to kill myself when it comes down to it. So my plan is to walk until I drop.

I do not want a funeral for me but if it helps the people I leave behind then I hope they can have one. I love my mom. I love my brother and my sister. I love my wife and her entire family. And I am just sorry. Sorry for everything and I hope that they will be able to forgive me for all of this some day so that they may be able to make their pain hurt less.

"I already know I do not have much of a direction in life. I always planned on committing to when I was 18 and now that I am just stuck. I am supposed to go to college but I do not really want to and Imnow signed up for classes but unsure of my major. I wanted to move out at 18 too and have someone that wants to be my roommate but I just cannot make myself take up on that opportunity.When I was 16 I had plans and full intentions to kill myself by a certain date, but then my (now ex) partner asked me about 10 days before that. I never told them this but still I based my entire future around that relationship. And I still had suicidal ideation throughout the entire relationship, the only thing that changed was that now I had a tangible reason to not do it right away. I feel like at that point I accepted that I was going to die from suicide, it was just now I was playing the waiting game for the final straw. I know that I still have time and opportunities and I know that I am skilled enough so that if I could push myself do to make something out of myself, I probably could. I just do not want to since I just do not care about living . Plus if you are a bad person and have multiple untreated mental illnesses and trauma should not be okay by a certain point?

"I got prescribed to months worth of Lexapro (and to take half a tablet a day) right before my insurance expired (they were trying to get me enough lexapro to last me until I find new insurance). That was two months ago and I have been afraid of taking it since.I smoke weed on the daily because it helps calm my nerves for like 30 minutes so I could work on my writing and get in the zone. However, in the past week I have been incredibly depressed and the upcoming death of my cat I fear will make that 10x worse (it already is).Is it worth taking Lexapro or do you think it will kill my creativity? I can be creative without weed, its just a small jumpstart. I am more scared of losing it to the lexapro but I am also scared of my lack of motivation, energy, and depression.

"I no longer know what else to do but write this. I am not even sure what I expect to come of it except for hopefully support and sympathy and trying to see light at the end of this dark tunnel. I will preface this quickly with the fact that I am generally a very happy person, but I feel so defeated I do not know where else to turn. I have been with one woman the past 9 years of my life, and I am only 26. We have an immense story together over all that time, but I think like any person in my position, I thought we were going to last forever. We even share a kiddo together.When I learned she was pregnant, I really started to get my life together. We got married too around this time. I was working whatever jobs I possibly could, and I was always taking the next step forward to provide for my family. After about 2 years, and wanting more out of life, I overextended into a career I was not ready for. I made a few ""mistakes"" in their eyes and they politely asked me to leave. I was really devastated by this because it was a career I had put a lot of time and research into only for it to fall flat. Nevertheless, I pushed forward, and with constant strain from my wife's side of the family, I decided to move my family to my home state with the help of my side of the family. Things were no fairy tale, however. Our living situation was very bad, especially with a kiddo. Again, I started working, and only thanks to my best friend willing to let us stay in his home were we able to salvage the situation. For the first time in our relationship and marriage, my wife got a job with me while my mom watched our kiddo. We worked very hard together, and I cherish those memories a lot. I think due to all of the stress, we both decided to start smoking weed. I think she was 24, and I was 22 at the time. We were a very straight edge couple before then. Anyway, after about 3 months, we were back on our feet, but once we had our own place again and bills to pay, the financial strain started to hit again even with us both working. Mostly because of the long drive to get work and very little hours. I asked our boss for a raise and she said no, despite us working there for 6 months and always going above and beyond what was asked of us while others slacked, slept on the job, and had us covering their messes. We quit promptly, and afraid of losing our situation again, I uttered the words: ""If I have to work fast food, I will."" Well, I ate those words quickly. With no other job prospects in sight, I literally had to work at a fast food restaurant up the street despite all my prior work experience. I hated it at first. My wife and I played a lot of video games together, and in an attempt to better ourselves we started livestreaming. We had mild success together, but it was not enough to pay the bills. The thought of coming home to livestream after my horrid job was the only thing pushing me through. Once again with this job, I would actually run the entire restaurant with maybe just one other person while the managers would sit in the back. I did dishes, cleaned disgusting grease traps over and over, cooked all the food at the highest quality, and trained new members because people would quit left and right. I did this for about 6 months praying that our livestreaming would pay any sort of dividend. Despite the immense effort we had put into building a quality livestream and building a community, we just could not get it off the ground. I started heavily abusing marijuana because I felt so lost, and it made me feel good even when things were not good. I think with being the age I was, and the drug use, I started to experience a severe break in my mental health. Therapy resolved the issues almost entirely, but I did do pretty severe damage to my family as a whole while they carried me through that low point. No meds, no more weed, and I was back on track. Just to add a little more to that last section of the story too, I was really banking on being a popular enough streamer to get by in life. There was not anything else I wanted to do. However, smoking weed did open my mind to the thought of making music. When our streams would end unsuccessfully, I would get high, and stay awake another 4 hours or so into the night and write music even though I had never done such a thing my entire life. The music was pretty bad, but it was entertaining enough to keep me distracted while I tried to escape my struggles. I tried to become a manager at the restaurant, but somebody else always got promoted before me. Even people working there for 2 weeks were on the path to becoming a manager before I was. I did mention a lot that I was more interested in livestreaming or music panning out for me than I was working as a manager, but the thing was that I was literally doing the entire job anyway in hindsight. When I made an actual shot at it, I was told no. We had the worst skeleton crew you could ever imagine. Frustrated, I quit the restaurant, I quit livestreaming, I quit gaming, and actually caught a break getting a new sales job with an unlimited earning potential. I was still writing music as sort of a gag to show my friends and express my creativity. The sales job was a major blessing, but I sucked very bad at it. Every single person told me they were not interested in the product I was supposed to be selling. My sales manager actually commented about never seeing someone quite as bad as me at sales. It hurt me a lot, but I figured it just was not for me despite how much I loved the thrill of talking to people so directly and trying to get them excited about a product. I tried 2 sales jobs, and eventually found a chill job doing security work. I never forgot what I learned from my sales jobs. With all the time to think about my future at my new job, I finally decided to give my music career a real go. I would actually produce music on an old laptop in my car at the worksite. I had worked in almost every industry besides automotive and medical so I really did not know what else to try. This is where it all gets very interesting. My security job was reasonably getting my family by while I did this whole music thing. With the combination of all the things I had learned in the past, music was actually my greatest tool in the end. It helped me sell myself as a person to get the things I wanted. My music never spread the way I saw some others did. Millions of plays, thousands of plays, hell, I was lucky to even get 20 plays. It did not matter. I could show people my songs, socialize, and get everything I really wanted which was to be heard. I cannot express how much life was getting exponentially better day by day. I was so confident that my music was just one good ear away from either going viral or helping me to my next big opportunity. Naturally, with my charisma growing, my marriage getting stronger, and really selling myself as a true rockstar, I was ready to take things to the next level. My wife had discovered her bisexuality over the course of this time since starting to smoke weed. We talked about having experiences with other women, but as I am sure any person knows, it is difficult to swing getting lucky with one person, let alone two at the same time. I saw it as a good challenge, but never expected it to work. After a solid year at my security job, I had produced so much music. I loved every single song so much, and still I was not able to really turn a profit on anything. I did have one song reach 100,000 plays, but it hardly translated into any traction as far as followers or return listeners. To reiterate, I was more focused on how I could use music as a tool to gain the interest of another woman in my life rather than money. I met many different women, had wonderful experiences, but my wife and I really wanted to be with someone the way we were with each other. Long term, committed, etc. Before long, we actually had attracted someone. We talked for about a month, and made things official. We were all dating as a ""triad."" If you could not guess, as a man, living like this was heaven on Earth. I even found a job in this automotive parts factory making great money while I worked on my next huge musical project. Unfortunately, dating like this with all the new emotions really tore me up at times. I experienced a lot of jealousy while I provided on the job side of things while my girlfriend and wife stayed at home. My mental health broke down again for the first time in years, and out of paranoia, I broke up with my girlfriend. She was pissed at me, and did not take being broken up with lightly. I regretted my decision within days, and begged her to come back. She declined over and over. My wife and her kept seeing each other while I worked, and I mostly found it fair just because of the mistakes I had made. I was determined to show my girlfriend that I still loved her and make amends. I leveraged my factory work into an even better factory job making more money and with one of the most solid companies nationwide. I drastically improved myself as a person, and I even found a confidence being ""alone"" like never before. My wife actually missed the 3 of us being together just as much as I did, and then she convinced my ex-girlfriend to give me another chance. To celebrate, I took them on a vacation to a beautiful beach condominium. We all grew closer, and I even decided to try smoking weed again with my ladies after being sober for like 2 years. I had never been so high in my entire life, I was literally shaking and could barely even use the microwave to make myself food. It felt like the most earned vacation of a lifetime even in my own head. I had an extremely pleasant thought that was something like: ""Wow, I am really just a normal guy with nobody coming after me to hurt me being like this. I can just live my life and enjoy this heaven forever."" Our relationships peaked so hard here. I was actually in heaven, with only a little paranoia of my nontraditional dating habits coming back to bite me in some way. Great money, 2 beautiful women, my credit was building to buy a house, and a new album ready to be dropped on the horizons. With my relationships settled, the only thing I was really suffering in was the typical 9-5 work in a factory which had nothing to do with the career I actually wanted: music. With a sizable savings to give my music all the promotion, hard work, and love it really needed, I quit my factory job. I told my ladies, and they were very apprehensive. This is where things take a drastic turn for the worst. Little did I know, my chicks were still actually having some issues regarding the whole relationship. It came in a way I could have least expected. My wife, the person I had been through thick and thin with for 9 years, came out as being fully gay. It makes my stomach turn to even think about how they sat me on the bed to tell me that. I thought I had done something wrong to mess things up, or they were mad about the job, but no. It was something entirely out of my control. My girlfriend looked at me with sorrow because she knew it meant it was over for us too even though we had just fixed things. I wrote the song ""Mistakes Are Lessons"" as the final flex that despite not making a mainstream appearance, I was living the life that every dude on Earth could have dreamed of. The beat came first, but I did not finish the 2nd half of the lyrics until I had been broken up with which is why they are kind of somber sounding. I am now going through a divorce, I am unemployed, and despite searching for a job, I cannot find one. Even if I could, I am almost completely spent as a person. I had a short run going back to school thinking I wanted to be a doctor, but after studying biology, it really just hammered into me more that I need to pursue my passion of music. The only energy I have left to give this world is my music and my story. I am scared writing this because at the moment I have $24 in my bank account. I have never reached such a rock bottom in my life. The hardest, most depressing thought of my life is returning to the typical work grind where I have to hide my real personality. People always made me feel like I had to live and experience things to create great music, so that is what I went and did. I know there is still more experiences to be had, but I feel like I have learned lessons no man my age should know. I have gone from living in heaven to feeling like a slug. I do not know what else to do. Believe it or not, there is so many details I left out of this story I would love to tell, but it is already long enough as is. On a happy note, I ended up in a long distance relationship with an amazing friend that I actually had been telling my life story to for months on end. She did not care about my past, and she was actually the first person to ever describe my music as ""beautiful."" I really do try and make it that way sometimes, and she saw that. I have never loved someone as much as her. All I want out of life at this point is to tell my stories, listen to music, create music, perform music, and still be financially sound. that is really the whole baseline of this story too. I have been chasing financial freedom for years trying different things only to be taken advantage of time and time again. I just do not know if I can do it anymore. Being in this situation makes me feel like a failure as a Dad, a failure as a musician, and a failure as a person. Will I ever be enough? Financial Freedom",Depression

"I am not quite suicidal, but I am not quite okay. I am I am limbo. I lay in bed, trying to sleep and I have so much anxiety about going to work. Numb from depression.

I want to sleep. Stay in bed. I think if I die, my problems would go away. But at the same time, I do not want to die. I want to enjoy life. I sink to that level of borderline SI, but then I go back to thinking how I could improve my life.Today, I got a friend request from my cousin. you would think that would cheer me up. No. It made me more depressed and feeling useless. The reason? Three week ago, I sent her a friend request. No reply. No response. I assumed she just does not check her social media often. However, it occurred to me today. If she sent me a friend request, that means she declined my friend request 3 weeks ago. Otherwise, it would have said she accepted my friend request.

"I have been getting depressed lately due to some issues with work. If you have ever read about administrative burdens increasing physician burnout during COVID times, it is exactly that.

I will not get into more about the situation here because it is a long, complex, and specific situation. I have tried everything I can to resolve the issue and manage my own attitudes but I know deep down that until the issue that is contributing to my depression is resolved, I will not feel better.I have kind of hinted at my state of mind to several people and they did not seem to pick up on it, but then one guy did and said I need to get help.

"it is too long for me now. Everything just gets worse and worse. there is nothing in this world i know, but pain, sadness and tears. I just need someone that loves me how I am, someone that does not only criticizes me or says how bad I am and everytime I find a person like this I think I get friend zoned instantly, I mean that does not mean that is bad, but I want a person that lays beside me in my bed and that I can hold tightly and feel safe with. And why can I give so many people good advises, but I can help myselft even a little bit. I think I am just too broken for everything. A long time I could hide my sadness, but now it is hard to not break down in tears every single second I am awake and that is just annoying. And even my friends I can talk about everything, I do not think they want to hear me more crying about myself, so that is why I just stopped talking about my feelings lately. One example is, I met this girl only around 2 months ago and I think i could talk with her about everything that bothers me, but lately I feel like everytime I say to her that I am sad, she just gets annoyed by this and this really breaks my heart, because I really do not want to lose her, I already lost so many people in my life another one would break me completely. I really do not know what I am going to do the next years, I am so afraid that I am doing something really bad to me, because I do not want to disappoint my parents or my friends that I am so weak. I have never showed any of my weaknesses to anyone, but I do not wana do this anymore, I do not want to fake anything about me. I think life and everything around it, is just a cruel and depressing place. I hate it to be single, I just want to be loved, but I really do not think that anyone ever could really love me and this just fcks me up. There is no day in like 2 years now where I do not cry me to sleep. And on top of everything, in the last months everything around me changed and that to fast, I had to let go of long friends, I had to realize a close friend of mine is in deep depressions and so much more and I just cannot process all of it. I tried talking to that girl I mentioned before, but she acts completely different than at the first days I talked to her. She was like she did not tried to give a good advice or to comfort me, she just like said to me that I cannot change it and I should not bother about it, which is not really helpful. I mean I am not mad at her I am just confused and I am too shy to ask her why she is acting so different. I am just such a weak person, like I am not even trying anymore to be strong or sth because it does not matter, I can smile how long i want I public it does not will change anything ever. I do not want to kill myself, but at the same time I do not want to love anymore, I just want to not exist anymore and no one on this entire planet ever remembers me or even knows that I existed. Everytime this girl texts me, I can smile and even when it is only for a few seconds, in this few second I am truly happy and I do not think she knows that, but she probably does not like me the way I like her and that is the reason I do not want to confess my feelings to her, because I know this will just end up in she not texting me or not answering my messages and I think then I am done with everything. This might sounds stupid I know, but she is the first girl I met ever to just like me how I am and not to look a certain way and this feeling is just awesome, I felt like there was some hope for me. And I said to myself before I was texting so much with her, that I am not getting into a state like I am, but I just could not resist, I could not belive how perfect she is and that brought me to the point, where I maybe cannot live without her and that is even more terrifying, because I know on some day I will fuck everything up and Ill completely lose her. I could type so much more, but idk I think that was long enough. Oh btw I am 17 and I know this just could be phase, but like I said I cannot take this anymore and I do not know what to do now. If you are read this, till here i want to thank you. I love it to talk about my feelings and this place is probably the best for it.And yes that was all know thx and bye I think I am done with everything",Suicidal
"My beloved furbaby of 17yo passed yesterday. I have had her since birth, she followed me everywhere, wanted to be by my side for everything and even has moved countries with me. After 24+ hours of crying and feeling everything from anger to waves of sadness to the absolute numbness that normally comes with my depression, it feels like that little band that helped me function has snapped again. I do not want to sound so dramatic that I am like this because I have lost my dog, but God damn it I am like this because I have lost my best friend. I am scrolling through photos and clinging to her collar. My family think I am crazy for reacting like this to a dog's death, and yet I struggle to think of how I will act normal in work on Monday.

"I am a lazy piece of shit, no other way of putting it.

No. because that is how much of a lazy piece of trash I am, I am willing to ruin my own life because it gives me more comfort and I am fine with it. I am a waste of oxygen, and life.

I work in an urgent care and I got reprimanded. The first one was when I found a woman bleeding on the ground right outside the clinic and I went inside to get help because I could not lift her by myself. I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit.

This of course is not the case and we are all doing what we are doing for zero reason.So yes life might sound to many as this cool adventure that everyone needs to experience.

"Hello.I think I am in bit of dark place in my life, and I think it shows when I am at work. People do not really care about me, and mainly it is because I do not fit well in the group, and its dynamic. they are just not my kind of people, but I act mostly happy, and I do almost whatever people ask me to do, because that is what good colleagues do, right?But last Sunday we had a talk after work with a couple of beers (I work in a restaurant, so there is booze around), and one of them suggested the girls would rank the boys on looks, and on character, and the boys did do too vice versa. Anyways, I ended dead last of the men on the whole spectrum, and it made me feel uncomfortable. I mean, the question to begin with was cringe-worthy to begin with.Anyways, there is more going on with my life that does not fit well in my life, but I like to keep that private, if you do not mind.Anyways, but how do you hide your depression for others? Are you a great ""actor"", or does it show? What are your tactics/moves/tips?I am not willing to go with antidepressants, because I am going to, it takes your soul away.

"And has life gotten better?&amp;#x200B;No. Everything is worse.I had some depressive bouts leading up to 21 over how much I was missing out on things that would make me happy. I had never had a date, let alone a relationship, never drank or went to parties and had wild fun like the other people my age I was too meek and scared of everything and despite constant jobhunting, my age and inexperience only ever got me a part time job cleaning public toilets, which did not help as I already felt gross. I disliked myself quite a lot, as I was overweight, short, unhygienic, unattractive, and I acted goofy, childish, loud and overly sensitive. But I can say that I was a hopeful optimist. I still kind of liked myself; I believed I was a good person with a good mind, worthy of love and acknowledgement, and had dreams of working in my creative talents with my then-friends, falling in love, and generally never wanted much like a ton of money or any unique opportunities, just the average house and family life that everyone tends to get, which has always been my focus. And it seems easy enough for everyone else to get, right?I tried. I mean, I really did try, for a decade. I jobsearched like crazy for years while bouncing around my familys homes, doing unpaid work experience after unpaid work experience just to have enough skills to actually be employable, for something other than needing a friend of a parent to put a good word in for me to even qualify as a toilet cleaner. When my dad said he was moving away to live with his new family he invited me to come, but I was 25 and already felt like a leeching loser, so lived off beans and boiled potatoes just to afford a spare room in a house share enough to be out of his way. I got into being more healthy and lost 55lbs during that time, cleaned up my hygiene and nutrition. It stuck, and I now go months without eating any sugar, learnt to cook well, and exercise every day. I went back to university to meet new people, as all my friends had drifted off in life or abandoned me altogether, and I also still had not had a relationship, so thought it would be a great way to meet likeminded people; adult connections that stick around and are mutual, as opposed to the ones Id made in childhood that had drifted off around 21. It was draining, but I did manage to graduate. Trying to study, work, look after myself and meet people was hard to do all at once because I never really was good at growing up Id had a 4 year agoraphobic stint in my teens that had given me anxiety and really damaged my ability to socialise or develop like a normal person, I have been unable to relax in normal situations or properly approach mandatory experiences of growing up like other people do. I was trying really hard to push through it though. I really did try.And what did I get for trying?I managed to upgrade my part-time minimum wage toilet cleaning job to a part-time minimum wage retail job, and have been stuck there for 5 years. I cannot advance in it because my completely broken social skills and introversion makes me really awful at customer service. And because my degree was creative where employability is based off contacts, privilege and experience, I am still no more employable or liable for better work than I was before university, I just have more debt to pay back. I went to study film, which has always been something I have loved probably the only thing in life I have ever felt *in* love with. After college, which ended when I was 20, I felt a bit like the magic had gone, because I saw behind the curtain which took a bit of the magic away, but was still interested in a career in it. Now after university, at 29, I despise it. I have no interest in working in film. 90% of my hobbies were creative based, and I do not even have any creative ideas anymore. I carried this internal sense of imagination and a case of maladaptive daydreaming with me for so long in my life that it was a huge part of me, but now all creativity is drained and I do not know who to be without it. My head is so out of it, I can barely register and react to things that happen in the *real* world anymore, let alone create complex things in my head. Sometimes I react late to conversations *I am in the middle of.* My cognitive function has crashed and I do not even think I could handle a harder job than retail now. But film was a secondary reason to study, I went to uni to open up socially and actually feel like part of the human race again. And did I? No. I did not have a single date, a single relationship, I did not make a single close friendship or helpful connection, because I am awful and broken and not likeable, interesting or attractive enough for people to want to put effort in for or stick around with anyway. My social skills are actually worse, because my mental health problems and self-image are worse. The idea of love and relationships have always been a huge trigger for my anxiety, probably because I wanted it so much (having a family was basically my biggest life dream), but my self-esteem is so non-existent that my philosophy now is, if I like someone, they are already too good for me. And now its pretty much impossible because I have come to find people so insanely confusing and unrelatable and I have not found anyone that comes close to otherwise in over a decade. At least at 21, I kind of understood the generation I was around, but the world seems so scary and aggravating and confusing now, I do not know how I am supposed to relate to any of the younger people I am around who want to follow each others social media accounts or talk in memes, when I am older and just want to have real conversations. How the fuck do university students manage to get into so many relationships when they just seem to talk about weird shit they saw online and the sesh? I do not understand people anymore, and my odds of finding a new best friend or a relationship have plummeted to non-existent as a result. I have not been really timid and untrying throughout this time either. I genuinely got involved, put myself out there, engaged in conversations despite being a massive introvert, even arranged some days out, started drinking and went to a few parties, and tried my best to be human. But apparently people did not find the attempt good enough. No-one has ever shown an interest in wanting a connection with me. Th biggest change in life I got out of university was getting wasted for the first time, but that has now evolved into me just wanting to drink all the time, despite the fact that drinking only every makes me cry anymore, I still just want to do it every night. I do not because I had an alcoholic mum growing up, and I also still try to tell myself I want to focus on being healthy and nutritional. And especially mental health-wise, people say that stuff helps. But does it? No. that is bullshit. I do not eat anything that is not nutritionally beneficial, I get so many vitamins a day and only eat fresh meat and veg. And yet, I am still tired and sad all the time, and most of my joints and bones constantly crack and hurt. And do I feel better about myself after all the effort and worry I put into reading every food packet, forcing myself out of bed to work out, forcing down disgusting, flavourless meals because I am paranoid about the extra calories sauces and flavouring would add? No. I have developed a massive case of body dysmorphia, I find myself grotesque and I despise myself more than ever. I used to just dislike myself physically and behaviourly but now I do not even think I am human. I used to know I was overweight, but still likeable enough to not die alone. But damn, now I envy the people that get to cut me a wide berth. *I am* stuck with having to be around myself. If I were any of the people I am attracted to, *I* would not want me kissing me or making eye contact during conversation with me either.If getting 50,000 into student debt still cannot get me a relationship or friendship, if focusing and stressing so hard about what I eat and how I live still makes me even more utterly hateful of myself, if creativity was my passion and now my head is so disoriented and depressed that my ability to be creative has completely died for good, then I think I have tried enough. I cannot keep trying and failing. I am pretty sure I am done.I am not an 18 year-old who still has their best years ahead of them. I am 30. I have statistical, experience-based evidence that it does not get any better. I refuse to try for another 30 years and potentially get my first date or my first proper job at the age of 50. At that point, its just not worth it to me, and I know there are going to be some people who say it is who say life begins at 40 - but it is not. For most people, life begins at 16; from there, they make close friends, learn to drive, have wild sexual encounters and spontaneous travel adventures, find a home they feel comfortable in and have the strength and energy to make money to maintain it, and most importantly, they find love with someone who thinks they are worth something. I have done none of those things. But I *promise you,* I have tried.I am a logical person. I am a third of the way through my life, and its been a failure so far. Even if I tried for another third and succeeded, and then got to enjoy the fruits of that success with the last third, that is only a third of my lifespan worth living, and that is not enough of a percentage to make the extended struggle worth it to me. Its easier to just call it a failed attempt and go. I am honestly kind of glad that 30 is coming up and I made that promise to myself. It gives me a pointed reason to show this is not some spontaneous emotional reaction, but a legitimate planned attempt to try and improve things that has not worked out. I honestly have thought about offing myself early, but I guess my dad would like a photo of me at my delayed graduation (because of the restrictions), as he has a photo on his wall of all his kids and stepkids, but none of me, as I have not succeeded in anything. So I guess Ill wait for his benefit? (Before anyone says, I am not close to my dad, or any of my immediate family. Hanging around for their sake is not a legitimate reason. Blood is just a viscous liquid that transports oxygen, vitamins and nutrients around the body, it does not create convenient responsibilities to other peoples lives because that blood shares a similar coded structure). At this point, Id be glad to go. I have had suicidal points in the past but they were always emotional (and I always bear through them alone, having no-one I am close to or I feel really cares for or gets me). I always would not *want* to feel that way, get scared about it, not want to die because I wished my life would be different, and have a breakdown or deafen myself with distractions or something. But now I am genuinely, legitimately out of hope to the point where I am completely numb to it and I am not even upset anymore. Life is what it is. I have no emotion. What would I be sad about? The loving relationship Id miss out on? Its obviously not happening. And what a tragedy it would be to miss scraping by on living in a shithole month to month on an unliveable salary, eh? I guess I am only posting this because I am no longer myself at all - instead of being that bubbly and childish yet worrisome and cautious overly-emotional 21 year-old baby, I am now an untalkative, slow, ill-tempered borderline alcoholic who feels nothing. Id always felt it seemed selfish to pity myself when other people have it worse and I always cared way too much about what people think, but I do not care anymore, and I feel I have earned the right to be selfish and I deserve to have people know that if everyone other normal person can get recognised, respected, valued, wanted or loved to some degree, then I at least tried.I do not expect things to change over the next 6 months, instead of trying anymore I will just spend the time daydreaming about the better life inside my head and getting affairs in order. I am interested to see and hope that I have the bravery to go through with it in 6 months, but this really does feel like a turning moment where I have accepted it. I feel all that fear from when I was 21 has gone and I have the personal skills and the hopelessness to get out of this failed excuse of a lifetime.Sorry this was so long. And hopefully this does not just automatically confirm the idea that things *never* improve for anyone. If you are young and are thinking that, things may work out differently for you - it is a possibility. They just did not for me is all. When I was 21, I made a self-pact that if nothing in life was better by age 30, Id kill myself. I turn 30 in exactly 6 months.",Depression

"I do not even know why I am writing this but i need to get this off my chest. I am 21, about to graduate college with very good grades, already have a decent job where everyone seems vey nice and helpful. I have very loving family, i have friends who i talk to almost every day but still even after everything i have i feel empty. I just do not want to exist anymore.it is not that I am sad but that I just can not imagine myself living. I have not tried anything yet but i do not trust myself. I try to keep myself as distracted as possible to stop thinking about it but the moment I am unoccupied I just start thinking about it. I even imagine what the people around me will be like after i die. I do not know when it started exactly but I have been feeling like this for years. In my first year of college i found myself staring down the stairwell ready to just let gravity do the work, then I had a accident in my 2nd year and the only thing i remember feeling during that was relief. I try to live by bargaining for time with my thoughts. I say to myself let us just try living for a week to watch the new episode of a show or let us just wait for that movie to release, or let us just wait until I have visited that place but it is not working anymore.

"I would not say I am often just super depressed or in agony, though lately I am pretty damn sad and hopeless. But mostly I am not constantly suffering horribly or anything. But. If life does not work out, if its more effort than what I get in return, I do not want to keep doing it. At my age, its unlikely to change substantially. And sure, it could. And I could expend a lot of emotional energy, time, effort, money, whatever, to try. But more often than not, when I have made myself keep doing that, it has either returned nothing, and I just lost time and money and happiness and confidence, or the bit of positive was not worth the effort. I stumbled onto something (someone actually) that was worth the effort. It was and is pretty new, but in just a few months we connected to the point it became genuine love. She wanted to see me, talk to me, be with me. And I felt the same way about her. And the rest of life felt lighter and more enjoyable because of it, like even those other things felt worth the effort. Something happened that changed her. It was mostly my fault, but I still have a hard time seeing it as something that should have completely changed how she feels about me. We still talk and have been seeing each other occasionally, but its not the same. She does not seem excited at all to see me, or talk to me. We only see each other when I ask to see her. Anything romantic, flirtatious or certainly sexual seems to have stopped. I am still in love with her. Its really hard to let go when I know she wanted me just as much before, and since I am still the same person she loved. And since it took this long in life to meet someone like that, it just is not likely to happen again. If I lose one of the very few things that was worth the effort, I do not know. I just do not want to keep doing this. I cannot leave though, because I have 2 kids I really care about, and they love me, a lot. But Ill just exist for them, just a she will, dead or dying inside but pretending I believe this is all worth it, for their sake. It does not have to be a solution, it can just be a choice.",Suicidal

"About two months ago I was out of state to visit my friend of 10 years (well say M) and i stayed for 2 weeks. During this time I was fighting with my boyfriend and she was instigating hard along with her mother which then put me in a place to break up with him. We got back together 20 minutes later knowing this is not something that can be done from another state like this, and M being disappointed in me says do not worry, when you break up when you get back you can come stay with us again. this did not sit right with me because she said When. So a week after my trip while I am home she stops responding to me for about a month, then out of nowhere sends a huge paragraph about how my boyfriend is breadcrumbing me and isolating me from my friends. She said this because when she texts me i take a couple hours to respond. M is however notorious for not responding for days weeks or months. Since over a month ago I have not had any connection with her other than the one message. I responded but she still has not. My friend of 4 years (b) I did not usually hang out much but since my relationship was becoming more steady and we were learning to take out time apart I started hanging out with her more often. She lives about 45 minutes from me but i did not mind since i enjoy the ride. Around a month ago my boyfriend had broken up with me and was very shitty about it, i was sure it was going to be the last time. So i went to Bs place for comfort and to calm down. She makes me promise not to get back with him, and her boyfriend who was also my friend gave me a whole lecture on why my boyfriend is a pos. Naturally I went back to my boyfriend (G) anyway. we have broken up plenty but only gave our belongings back twice or so. Our relationship is more dramatic than anything, we know that but to my friends its abusive. I have reason to believe M and B just wanted me to listen to them. To be in control of me. My boyfriend is nothing like how they portray him. However that is the reason they cut me off, was because i took him back. Most people have just given me the advice of hanging out with family instead but everyone knows the difference between a friend and sibling. I do not have a close relationship with them seeing as i do not do well with the brutal honesty and bluntness of their personalities. The conversation will always come down to why I am so full of excuses when they ask about my mental health. Recently I have been spiraling in my depression and i genuinely have nobody to go to other than my boyfriend but your partner cannot help everything. My social life is important to me and watching my boyfriend be harassed and loved by all of his friends makes me feel so pathetic. I decided to start going to the gym alone to help dilute the feelings but it just makes me lonelier that i have no one to talk to. I have always attracted people who take me for granted or want to control me because I am easy or impressionable.I also suffer from PCOS and I am supposed to be getting a diagnoses for bipolar. All of these things are putting me in a position of feeling like id be better off in a psych ward. Not for protection, but so that i will not be a burden on anyone or myself anymore. I have been inpatient before and while its not fun it will make everyone else happy. I lost everyone.",Depression

"Hi folks.I am 31 and have had depression since I was 16, tried different antidepressants and currently on one. there is nothing really wrong in my life, I have trauma but does not everyone.

"I am feeling lately really like taking my life. I am diagnosed with BPD and I just feel like I cannot/do not want to keep living a life where I am forced to live with the actions I sometimes commit due to my trauma induced addled mind. Actions like exploding in uncontrollable rage with those that I love over minor or percieved slights, including, yes, my beloved house animals. I feel like a dirty creature that grew up only observing violence and chaos, and now I am struggling futilely to be anything but that with little to no success. I came accross another post that perfectly describes the feeling inside of me and read it all and did not notice up until the end that it was not actually written by someone with BPD, but rather someone whom was apparently deeply hurt by a former lover that has BPD. I started reading what seemed like a poem written by someone is account of the mental illness and kept reading further to see how they have overcome their struggles only to be met with gut wrenching disappointment at the sentiment that the pwBPD has little to no possibility of bettering themselves, and the story in itself has a terribly unhappy ending.

"I came onto this subreddit so long ago, and here I am again. I am about to be a second year undergraduate student, currently taking summer classes, and I am practically failing. In my fall and winter semesters, I did great, 3.93 GPA and was planning on focusing solely on my organic chemistry classes throughout the summer. But before summer classes began, I took a job working in a hospital, since I am hoping to apply to med school and be a doctor at the end of my undergrad. The job was a 3 day a week, 12 hour night shift, and it fucked with my grades so hard. My job began at the same exact time as I started Organic Chemistry 1, and needless to say, I did horrible. My first exam, I got a 40%, and it only got worse from there. The class is known to be hard and the grading scale is generous, but I did so bad, and barely had the time to learn any concepts. I got home from work so exhausted that I did not want to do any studying, just sleep. I decided to quit my job before Organic Chemistry 2 started, and while I am glad I am no longer at the job, a problem that I did not foresee is currently happening. I really did not learn that much in Organic Chemistry 1, and Organic Chemistry 2 THRIVES on info from that class. I feel so lost in the class right now, and we have an exam on monday. I have been studying the past 2 days and so far, I feel like I have not learned a fucking thing. there is so much that I should already be expected to know, but I do not because of how poorly I did in OChem 1. Like I am so angry at myself, and I am going to do even worse this time around. I feel so stupid, and its actually important that I do well in these science classes. I get so demotivated whenever I join the online lectures because I never feel like I am understanding a thing that they are saying. there is so many vocabularic terms that I have never heard of because I barely got through the OChem 1. I am so sad about this whole situation, and colleges are going to see how much I struggled. I have already been so sure that I am not going to get into med school, but this is just making it worse. I have been studying for 2 hours and it is just been pure confusion. I am so upset right now, and I am seriously considering s\*\*\*\*\*\*. I know you are going to think that this is a stupid reason to consider such an act, but in a household that prioritizes grades over everything, with 3 successful sisters who are making so much money as dentists, I feel like I will never amount to anything as close to them. And they expect me to be even better than them. I feel so stupid, so lazy, and so good for nothing. Scared",Suicidal

"When ever I get this hypothetical question I cannot decide. Because 10 years ago; a younger me without depression existed. Some of my happiest memories took place, my friendships were deeper , and I had considerably less stress in my life. But I cannot help but wonder that if I go back to before I got severe depression would I be able to go back to that time and enjoy it; or would I still have my current depression( because I know what is coming). As much has Id love to go back in time and make better decisions; go to college early, be more honest with the people closest to me, take more pictures, have more fun, be a better person, and do considerably better in school, going back that far would change who I am now. I would have never met my current partner; never experienced the last year ( the same way). And if I had to go back and live through the happiest years of my life with severe depression, it would hurt me a lot. If you could go back to 10-20 years into the past with all the knowledge you had now : would you?",Depression

"Met a girl and we both fell madly in love, the love we had I have never experienced before. Everything seemed so perfect. Then I caught her loaning her car out to her ex, then she rented a garage for him to store his stuff at our apartment complex. I finally put a stop to it all. We moved and tings were fine.!I would eventually ask her hand in marriage and she said yes. Covid happened and we got pregnant and ever since the arrival of our son she has completely pushed me away. She acknowledges it and we have talked about it a great length. She will not even let me parent because she is obsessed with our son. I love my family to death but I feel like what we once had is gone. There is nothing that I can seem to do to make her happy. I parent our son when she works, I clean the house make the bed and wipe down the counters I even vacuum and do laundry and once every other week I deep clean. I work 3rds she works 1st. I parent him all day sleep for about 3-4 hours work come home repeat. I write her personal heart felts letters, I write her poems and I do things spontaneously for her and it does not seem to matter. I have begged for us to get a sitter so we can go out and she refuses to leave our son with anyone. I have major depressive disorder with ocd and ptsd with hypersensitivity anxiety disorder. I am constantly triggered and for the most part all I do is cry. I thought she was the one and since our son came I feel I have been replaced. I have no family or friends but she does. I am drowning and I do not know how much longer I can hang on. The only thing that matters I feel has been taken away from me and that includes my son and his mom.

"Since last summer I am in a spiral of losing myself. I am currently ""working"" on my master thesis in architecture together with my girlfriend, who also lives with me.

First I hoped that this will just go away if we push through but it became worse and worse. I reached out for help, I am seeing a therapist, visited my doctor who gave me citalopram and I am taking 10mg since 4 days. So I am working on getting better but I started to ask myself: Am I really depressed or am I just procrastinating at an absurd level? I mean I am weeping daily because of our thesis and I just do not see me working on or even finishing it. I have better days but as soon as it gets harder I just crumble. Am I just so lazy that I put myself in this misery so I do not have to work? I will also talk to my therapist but she is in holidays now..

"So, I deal with anxiety, some depression, and have a lot of trouble with change. I am very good at hiding it, though. I am currently working two jobs, one in my field which will not, unfortunately, turn into full time, and one in retail to fill out my free time and pay the bills. I make ends meet, put 10% into 401K and save some too. The problem is that I am being pushed to'find a better job.' One that is full time. The idea of the unknown and Change scares me to death. I know that there are jobs out there, but with COVID, any new job means I am the first one on the chopping block if things change or get worse. Then what?To make matters worse, my parents are constantly telling me about things that I 'should apply for.'. Not that they completely understand my credentials and what jobs match me. I just cannot get it to stop. Yes, I would like a single full time job, but the pushing is really getting to me.

"I have struggled with depression for almost 20 years. Now it feels different. It feels stronger, it feels darker. I can see my reflection in the mirror but I do not know who I am. Who was I before? Am I even any different? Sleep used to be my escape from myself but my dreams are vivid and awful now. The anxiety has crept into my unconscious. I am alone inside of myself. I have been taking lamictal for 15 years and recently I have gone without them for a few weeks due to unfortunate circumstances. I know I am experiencing withdrawal from them. My mind is foggy and distracted. I cannot concentrate on even a television show I enjoy. The things that used to soothe me are no longer working. Every day is the same as the last in my mind. I tried to quit smoking cigarettes...but I cannot seem to let go of them. My therapist has me confused and scared about what could be wrong with me mentally. I have broken up with a very close friend because they accused me of being selfish and toxic. Maybe I am. But I am just trying to survive. I do not want to die. I just want to be okay. I cannot work. My finances are being taken care of by my 60 year old mother who works overtime to support me through this. I am forever grateful for her sacrifice. The shame of not being able to support myself as an adult is weighing heavy on my self worth and esteem. I am in a very dark place and I am afraid. Sometimes I lay in bed and think about all the people in the world and how a lot of them feel lost or scared or just empty like me. How can I be on this planet with so many people and feel completely isolated. My friends love me. My family loves me. My boyfriend loves me. I know this. But it does not cure me. I am my own enemy. My mind is a prison and I silently scream internally every day. how is that for dramatic? I cannot find the words to express myself",Depression
In the last 3/4 years it was been difficult for me to be comfortable in a group of people because I am always the person with few friends and one of the few without having a relationship with someone. This thing started to affect me mentally because in high school I was barely invited to my friends parties and group activities without any reason and in college I had some bad moments with my colleagues that made change of course (but I was not feeling well in that course too). Then I had a crush in a girl but she did not want anything with me and never gave me attention to me while I was trying to be friendly with her. There were times I felt a completely incompetent and very depressed because I never felt what was being loved by someone and being included in a group of friends that wanted to do something with me.

"I do not think I am actively suicidal in this moment. If i really wanted to die right now i could just go to the river and jump off the bridge, but i guess my true preferred method would be to just shoot myself in the head.I have watched a lot of videos in the past of people killing theirselves and it mostly looks horribly painful. I cannot imagine the weight of my own gravity pulling me down only from the neck; were i to hang myself by jumping, eliminating the chance of pulling myself back up, chances are i would be decapitated if not unraveled from a mediocre try at tying the damn thing. And trains? Fuck that. Jesus.A gun though. If i could just get my hands on a loaded gun. I do not let myself. I still have to update my address on my drivers license, I have thought about going to a range but that would just be unfortunate for everyone else there.I live alone. So if i had a gun, even if its for protection, at some point i would probably do it. I would text my neighbor hey, I am really sorry, but i need you to call the police for me and tell them to come over. there is nothing you could have done, I am already dead. But thanks for always having been such a wonderful neighbor. Tell them the key is under the doormat.I have so many letters in mind to so many people. So many saying the same things. Sorry. Not your fault. Etc.But now I am going off on a tangent. I will not do it because i still have my family. My parents live nearby and my brothers away for college and i know how it would affect them.But i guess what i was hoping that someone could answer is which would be more lethal or at least because unconsciousness quicker: handgun shot through the temple or through the roof of mouth?Like i said, I am not going to do it. I know how it would affect those in my life. I do think about them. But i would just like to know.Sometimes it looks so quick, they drop instantly. But other times, you hear their groans even after.

"I am very familiar with the feeling of emptiness. I was pretty much born into it. Though I wonder how many have felt the more niche sides of it.&amp;#x200B;Anyone who has felt it is almost certain to have felt a sort of loss of identity or a loss of self, a loss of drive, motivation, or dreams. It seems rather common to feel alienated or isolated. Sometimes willingly isolated to protect everyone else around you.&amp;#x200B;But it goes deeper than that, does not it. In my experience, it is like my brain and me are two seperate beings. Waging this eternal war against one another. it is like I was never truly the one behind the wheel, like someone else was steering my body.&amp;#x200B;And when someone comes to close, no matter how much I consciously know that they care, my mind always turns to wanting to cur that off. Because I will screw it up eventually. I always do.&amp;#x200B;Even going through therapy, that emptiness makes you keenly aware of the fact that inside that office is different from the outside world. Whether it be because they are being paid to do this or because the rules they play by do not seem to match up with reality, or because they truly believe that someone needs their help, specifically and on a personal level. &amp;#x200B;it is like the rest of the world exists outside myself. Like I have my own little cave where I am stuck with this monster inside me. I look outside and I see how beautiful life is for them. But it is something I could never do. Like I am not quite human.&amp;#x200B;There are a lot of lies the emptiness makes you believe. It all seems so real because there are facts behind it, like you know that person just does not like you at all. Or that your presence does not matter, like you cannot impact even your own basic surroundings. it is just an endless battle just to keep things tidy and inevitably it begins to become void of purpose. It can even happen with your body. it is so much to consider and do and keep track of so you just do the minimal amount possible to survive. &amp;#x200B;it is all of these things and the desire to want more from this existence. You know it hurts, you know it sucks, you know you are alone. You wish so badly you could change it, sometimes so badly that there only seems to be one way out. Anyone who has felt this knows what that only way out is.&amp;#x200B;it is the memories, the flashbacks, the damage inside. This sense that I will never be whole. Like I will never be human. It digs deep and makes everything a worst case scenario. Do they know I am empty inside? Surely they do because everyone seems to just avoid me. Like nobody sees me and those who do purposefully go out of their way to stay away from me because they can see how sick I am. it is like an aura, a neon sign that says ""I am a monster"". So people just tend to stay away.&amp;#x200B;And your brain is taking in all of this information and putting it all through these very specific filters and everything just becomes dull. No matter how aware you become of it, it does not feel like there is anything you can do to stop it. It just goes on it is own.&amp;#x200B;There are more personal aspects of it but this has been my experience with it. I guess I just felt like sharing because I saw that little survey floating around and maybe others have it stuck in their mind too. &amp;#x200B;But I will say, I have not given up hope.

Hey guys I do not normally do not write stuff ever. Basically I have been suicidal since I was like idk 5 and now I am 18. I have probably been suicidal in the back of my mind 60% of the time since then and super suicidal like 40% of the time. Nobody rly knows I am depressed to the level I am. A few of my closer friends know I am on anti depressants but that is about it. I would not appear depressed to the average person. I try and be super positive like I do rlly nice things for homeless people not just donate stuff like actually sit down and talk and make them feel human. I have a great heart I just idk. I am tired. Lots of people would say I am really pretty and self hatred aside I am above average for sure. The only reason I have not killed myself is because I am scared of pain and/or surviving and living a worse life than usual. I have big dreams and would love to live life I just would rather be dead to be honest. I work hard I have 2 jobs my own apartment and my grades in high school were good. I just cannot shake this feeling. I think I just felt so alone for so long and hated on myself in my head so fuckint hard for so long it permanently messed up my brain. I love but also hate myself. I either look In the mirror and take a bunch of cute pics or if I can even get myself to look in the mirror Ill feel nauseous and feel like I am shutting down and then disassociate and think of ways to kill myself. I do not even know why I am writing this now I guess just to see if anyone relates. I think it bothers me that people do not take my depression seriously because I am pretty and nice . Not sure.

"Hi, this is kind of new to me but I figured I would look for advice from anyone in a similar situation. I have been with my partner now for a long time and we have a strong and loving relationship. During this time, I have become quite close with his family, especially my mother-in-law. Recently, my brother-in-law has started to date a new girl and we get along very well! However, I have found myself in a bit of an episode and unfortunately, I am really struggling with how everyone else interacts with her. For example, I feel as though my mother-in-law has started to pick favorites, based on the jokes she has made. However, the rational side of my brain is telling me that that is not the case. Any suggestions on how I get over this or how to feel more secure in my relationships? Not the favorite",Depression

"I am just so tired. there is nothing I want anymore, nothing to look forward to, no happiness, no dreams. Everything is dead within me. I have felt similarly for the past 15 years or so, but at least as a child/teen I still held on to some kind of hope... Now there is nothing. I used to wish I could be happy upon growing up, but the years have only brought me more pain.I do not belong to this world, I do not know why God sent me down here to suffer. The only reasons I made it to 23 are my dogs; I would not rest in peace knowing I left them alone, in the hands of my torturers to be mistreated/neglected. I have considered many times to just take them with me and jump off the nearest bridge, so we can all finally be free.I do not even want to be happy anymore, I just want to rest forever. To be gone once and for all, for my world to end. I do not care if there is an afterlife or there is not.The only reason I am typing this out, is because I want at least someone to know I was here and that I felt like this. there is no one in my life who cares, no one who would ""lose me"" if I died; I would just be a gone girl, one among many others who walk or walked on this earth. Just like now, the world will keep spinning. there is nothing anymore",Suicidal
"I just turned 25 this Monday, and I kind of wanted to end myself on that day for a few months now. did not do it. Now, I am still around, still miserable, still missing my ex, hating my living situation, and being uninspired. But I am also 25, and if I am not going to die, then I am going to regret living the way I am. This is a miserable existence that I do not know how to handle. I already left a message for my family, just in case, but the natural human instinct will not let me take myself out. This is pain. The longer you live in misery, the more you suffer and want to end it. Alternatively, if you are not going to end yourself, you are wasting life while being miserable.

I have completely supported the other person move on from breaking up with me but not processed any of it myself. We have only been together 5 years but they were my entire universe and I was not expecting it. I have invested so much and genuinely thought it would last forever and believed them when they told me it would.I have been stupidly hoping things would resolve because we started having sex again and acting like a couple but they no longer care about me. They have totally moved on. They told me today they did not care if I lived or died from coronavirus as long as I did not give it to them. I want to go to the river near my house and just fall into it forever. I do not want to be here anymore. I do not want to live. Other people deserve my resources on this planet I am fucking done.

"So first off I am a piece of shit human being. I have never been in trouble or been in jail but I am not a good person. My family excommunicated me. I do not have any friends except one and he is unable to help me. I fucked off my twenties (33 now) did not apply myself dripped out of college at 26/27. Lived with my Dad till he passed in Jan 2019. He was my best friend/confidant would call him everyday if I was out of town for work. A week after he died I was fired. So I took my dog Suka, sold everything I could and went out on the road. Ended up in Oregon. While surrounded by natural beauty and people who genuinely wanted to know me I just could not as I was in another dimension emotionally. Asjed for help form my Godmother in Arkansas. That was a mistake. Was literally asked by her (a social worker btw) if I was a retarded.... So because I have fucked over my family so many times nobody believes that I want/working on to be better. Back on the road.Ended up in Tulsa. Worked at a call center. Call center helps me get a place. Pandemic happens. Stuck in apartment being yelled at by people on a constant basis. I quit my job. Lose apartment. Asked for help from a cousin. Cousin has a roommate with three other dogs. Said roommate is a veteran. During a family get together with cousin in law coming back from deployment, the dogs get in a fight. Veteran roommate tackles my dog (old Shepard Husky mix) and less than a month later I had to have him out down. So in the last two and half years I lost two of my best friends. I lost everything. I live out of my truck once again. I have reached out to people but it is been a no go from them. One of them is still thinking about it but it is most likely going to be a no. I keep being told that I am worthy of a happy life. But everytime I work towards that the rug is pulled. Or I do something very stupid like quit a job. I am not worthy. The talents I thought I had have dried up. The relationships I thought I had have dried up. My patience has dried up. I am just screaming in a void. I do not have anywhere to go. I have nothing and I feel like nothing. No spouse no kids no dog no life. What am I doing here? I will not call the hotline. I do not want to be incarcerated. Because I am already living in a self made prison. I just cannot do this anymore. I do not want to this anymore. There is no hope for me. Right now I am just trying to decide between the revolver or the shotgun at this point. But I will probably do another self sabotage before it all ends. cannot do this anymore",Suicidal

"Everyone has their own lives and it is dumb of me to expect people to remember when they have said they will do something for me....but is it really that bad of me to expect people to remember me? I asked my roommate last week if he would drive me to a biopsy I had this morning, and he had come back super late the night before and was asleep when I needed him. My sister who has been helping me with my car payments had said she would be able to help me with the payment today, and we even talked about it yesterday and still, she forgot. I hate being a burden and I hate asking for help, so even ASKING these things of them is so fucking hard in the first place....having to remind them is even worse. I ended up just driving myself to my biopsy because I did not want to bother my roommate by asking him if it was still OK. I do not want to bother my sister about the money even though the payment will bounce and I will be charged an extra 100 in late fees because of it. Its literally so humiliating asking for help, especially when it comes to money, and reminding people that they said they would help is even worse.

"I just want to start by saying, that no matter what your occupation, being depressed is **hard**. *But*, I am curious to know if others in healthcare who struggle with depression, and even suicidal ideation, does it make it even harder? Sometimes I get to the point where I literally think I do not want this anymore. I do not want to do this anymore. and I have had family tell me maybe I need to go to the ER. But I know what its like to be a person who is suicidal in the ER. I know what its like to be a depressed/suicidal person on a psych ward; and the thought of me having to go and be there myself? It terrifies me. I know it would not help me. The answer to all of the behavior health/psych consults will always be simple &amp; cut and dry. **I do not want to live, I do not want to be here, I feel stuck and I feel like I do not belong.** there is never going to be a magical cure for that.

"I have always felt I was a ugly guy, or at least when I was 10 or 11 I started thinking about looks and hating mine. I am recently being told in therapy that my self image needs real work. I thought most people hated the way they look. Turns out everyone dosent like something is about themselves true but hating every thing about you enough to get angry and upset at pictures and reflections is not normal. So I tried the mirror bullshit of saying you are attractive myself but I couldng get it out. I was like Jim Carey in Liar Liar where he cannot say something hes knows is not true. I have been trying posting and allowing pictures of myself and even when I get compliments I cannot believe them. I will probably delete the one I put up not long ago.

"20M, below average height, lost all my hair so I am bald, grew up poor and still am, still a virgin, never had a gf, not white so I do not fit Eurocentric beauty standards for conventional attractiveness. Here are my findings: general, bald men are considered less attractive than men with hair across the board is a pretty big deal it seems, and the only remedy that can make up for it is money, for a 56 man to be rated equally to a 6ft man, he must make on average $175k/yr more due to Eurocentric beauty standards, whites are generally rated as more attractive than blacks and other poc, and vice versa in addition, general attractiveness correlates with higher incomes, as better looking people typically can get jobs and such more easily than no attractive people as society has reinforced the notion that beauty=value=wealthSo basically if you are short, bald, nonwhite and poor like myself you seem to be screwed, the numbers and data do not lie.

"Hi everyone, I wanted to write this to see whether or not people feel the same or whether or not I am going crazy. Basically, I am a 26 year old male and I am feeling bogged down by life and quite miserable. To give some background, I still live at home with parents, I have a fairly decent job, a girlfriend and a small group of close friends however over the past few years I have been struggling to feel content with life. I live in the uk and from a young age I have always craved adventure and living a exciting life. During my late teens and early 20s I have lived abroad, travelled the south east, been on multiple holidays but there is something I cannot quite put my finger on as to why I feel unhappy with life at the moment.Over the past few years transitioning from being a happy go lucky university student to then entering the real world has been a real struggle for me. The area I live has very little work opportunities and is known to be a less desirable part of the UK to live in. I feel that everyone does the same predictable routine of, working a job they hate Monday - Friday and then drink heavily on a weekend to numb the pain and then repeat (myself included). I really feel I am growing out of the uks drinking culture and want to completely change my lifestyle.I just feel that there has to be more to life than this. The majority of people I know are looking to get their first house/ engagement and to settle down but the thought of settling for this existence really scares me. I feel guilty for feeling this way, like I should be grateful that I have been dealt a fairly comfortable life. A week holiday once a year, an ok wage, food in the fridge and a caring family but I cannot help feeling that there has got to be more to life than this. I crave community, travel, adventure, good relationships, passion, excitement. But at the moment I feel dull and like the energy has been sucked out of me through joining the 9-5 rat race and falling into the trap that everyone does.I suppose the reason for writing this was to understand whether it is normal to feel like this?Is this just what growing up is all about? If anyone had any tips on how to change this mindset of these circumstances?Is it unrealistic to think life can be exciting all of the time?Thanks for reading and I would be grateful if anyone had any tips or pointers or even just to find if anyone is in the same boat!

"To all of the people who feel like their health is declining , please do not google your symptoms. I have been dealing with ilness anxiety for years now and everytime I would get anxious that something is wrong with me I would google it. This lead to many sleepless nights because google told me I most likley have some serious health condition. Please if you feel like something is wrong just forget google is there and go to the doctor. The bullshit written on google can seriously worsen your mental health and lead to severe depression. that is what happend to me. I was already depressed but the last month was probably the worst time of my life and it all started over using google for symptoms. I had just read an article about different types of cancer and what symptoms to look out when I realised something was not right (kind of private so will not go in detail) . Long story short after searching google for hours I came to the conclusion that I am experiencing a common cancer symptom. So I instantly call my doctor but he was not available so I had to wait 2 weeks for him to be available and than some for the test results to come out. During this almost 1 month of waiting I completely destroyed my already weak mental. I was constantly imagining scenarios in my head where I get diagnosed with cancer or some other dangerous condition. I could not sleep or do anyting other than sit in my bed and worry. More symptoms kept appearing and my health kept worsening. I seriously considered suicide as my life was not that good already and being diagnosed with something horrible would have been the nail in the coffin. My results came back and it turned out that it was not anything serious, most of the symptoms I was experiencing were stress based and I had tortured myself for nothing. I am not saying that you should not care if something is wrong with you, but please do not jump to conclusions based on google articles.

That when i finally went out for a hike, they did not see anything but a dangerous and reckless waste of time. No one even ask a picture or asked how was it. Fuck.

What i really want is actually simple, that someone would genuinely care. I am way deep in the rabbit hole that validation seems inappropriate anymore or any sign of response is pity or i tend to negate anything or mistrust anything because they will trap me.

During the midst of the pandemic due to stress/tiredness And anxiety at the way the world was going, I made a drug error. I did not kill anyone, or even hurt them, I just gave them the wrong drug. Id only been a nurse for 18 months last year. The stress of what I have done brought back my PTSD. Once I realised what Id done I reported it to my manager and she told me not to worry, and would support me. Fast forward four months, I have a disciplinary hearing and they fire me, dismissed from the trust I worked in for this one error. That was in September last year. A week after that my son (who lived with me and not his mum) it was discovered that he had abused his half sisters, who live with his mum when he was younger. So I could no longer have him at my house, as I have young daughters too. I went to the authorities about him, because his mum would not. My reasons for doing this was because I could see it coming out in the future when he was married with his own children and it would destroy his life, I think it was better off out now whilst still only young (hes 17). He said he was disgusted with himself and wish it had never happened. All this time later and I am still unemployed, as no one will hire me and I have seen my son once in a year. I am broken, no other way to put it. Falling",Depression
"I live in a semi-tropical area where plants take over everything, but I feel like I have this horticultural curse that reflects on my life in general. I have tried to grow plants for years, even building wooden planters, but then once the plants sprout I leave them outside where they get destroyed by inevitable torrential rain. I just moved and have a dirt backyard that gets sun, so I hoed the dirt up and planted grass seed after reading how to do it, but even in this area I messed it up somehow. I also bought and planted some already grown peppers, but I know I will abandon them to being eaten by insects or just not ever eat what grows on them. The only things I have grown successfully are basil and hot peppers, but I just left them without eating them until I used them up. it is reflective of everything else I do in life, really. I just do not care enough to do anything I once was happy doing. I have cut off contact with all friends, completely fake my conversations, never play music, drink too much, do not exercise, and stopped taking medications and going to therapy a couple years ago since I realized I cannot even be honest with myself and was definitely not honest with my therapist. I feel like seeing grass grow will be something that helps me feel like I have not completely abandoned my will to live. I cannot even get grass to grow!",Depression
"I am currently working 10min (walk) from home, so I walk there everyday. The thing is, I am back at my grandma's in a small city in Brazil and here there are soooo many stray dogs and cats on the streets, at least half of them in awful conditions, looking like they are about to die at any moment (either too skinny or with a lot of ugly bruises).I have to see that everyday, therefore I cry everyday and want to end this everyday, 4 times a day (the street I walk to have lunch has the worst dog of them all, he is barely breathing, supper skinny and there is nothing I can do). I lived here when I was a teen and it was so hard. When I moved out I was so relieved to leave all of this hurt behind, but now I am back, and details aside, I cannot really leave.Does anyone have any suggestions for me to feel less like shit being that:- I cannot help them because I am goddamn poor and barely have time and money for my sick cat at home.- I cannot quit my job.- there is no way to get to work without bumping into those poor creatures and relieving my trauma.- I will only be able to afford therapy by September.it is hard and I do not see any solution, I am actually skeptical about anyone helping me with some kind of idea/solution, but I do not really see an alternative, I am hoping for the best.

"Been feeling really suicidal lately, intrusive thoughts, dreams, and some small wonderings of if killing myself would make everything better. My parents are abusive assholes, and even though I am on my last few laps with them until I can be free my morale has slowly been cracking. So I have come up with some motivators to keep myself alive and one of the highest ones is that feeling I will get when I will be free, that look on my mother's face when I tell her what a bitch she is will be worth it in the end. The only reason I am staying alive is to spite my mother.",Suicidal

"Hi, people. Just wanted to vent a bit, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 5 months ago, been taking Zoloft 50mg since then. Overall, Id say I can see the results of the medication, my mood has significantly improved, anxiety has slowed down. The thing truly fucks me up right now are the random insane moments, which are triggered by trivial stuff; I get extremely upset, not only with myself, but also with my partner, who is the most supportive and important person in my life. When I have an episode, usually it starts from him irritating me, or doing something that really hurt me, but later on whilst sobering up from the insanity, I cannot remember why I felt hurt in the first place. I cannot even think about those reasons while arguing or accusing him of something.I hate that after such a long time I am still incapable of recognizing my paranoid and insane behavior. All of the feelings, my anger, pain, paranoia, fear, they all seem real and reasonable. I know my partner and he knows me better than anyone, that is why after everything I feel like a piece of shit, remembering all the disgusting thoughts I had about him.I hate that I can notice a pattern of a really toxic behavior from my side, that happens leas than it used to, but is still here. My boyfriend is really against increasing the Zoloft dose, but all those episodes resulting in self-harm, arguments, panic attacks and the worst bit, hurting my partner.How are you guys dealing with your mental health issues and loved ones? hurting people whom I love most",Depression

I trip over my words a lot too and sometimes I just kind of stare ahead as my brain is processing what to say back. Awkward.I used to be better at talking to people, never great but with friends I could talk and joke for hours but I struggle to even keep friends nowadays because I am terrified of saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way, but I do not want to be alone.

"Sorry but this will probably be rambling. I am having a harder and harder time finding a reason to do anything anymore. I have a great job but I cannot focus. Moved into a nice new home, but cannot even unbox the first thing. Going through a rough divorce, but I always said she was my light, and now without her I cannot see a reason to do anything. Nothing seems worth it anymore. Being in her presence made me a better person, made me feel I could do anything. Now I struggle to make it to the bedroom door every morning. For the last few months I have leaned heavily on my support group, but I can feel them stepping away as I overburdened them time and again. I am afraid to tell my therapist and I do not know why. Maybe I am afraid they will lock me up. All I know is I spent 27 years lost in the world before I met her, and then 7 years feeling like I had found heaven. Now I wish I could feel nothing. That would be an upgrade. I am just empty. So empty. I do not see how I can do this without her in my life. I thought moving out of our shared house would make things better. But it is 1000 times worse. I cannot keep feeling like this, but I do not see a way out. I need her. So badly. She was my everything. I even loved her flaws. Probably loved them most of all as that is what made her human. I do not know what to do. I just know I need her. I have to find a way to move on without her. But I cannot even imagine tomorrow in my head right now. To say the least of a future. I am so tired and so empty. And the world feels so dark. And I do not know what to do anymore.

"Cw abuse and suicide attemptI guess I just need somewhere to vent. I have struggled with suicidal ideation since I was about eleven and because I never attempted, my parents never cared, no matter how intense they got. So I gave up on it and just kept it to myself.I got some help later in life and was diagnosed with PTSD from peer and familial abuse and BPD. I also struggle a lot with my parents trying to throw me to the rocks with coping with my autism. Every therapist and help I have been provided always was the mind set that I was not suicidal enough. it is hard for me to keep my mind from splitting, so often when it went this route I just dropped that provider. I am not paying you to pretend you care, you know?Then, it happened.The stress of my failing writing career, failing marriage, and relationships imploded last night and I just OD'd. it is a blur, but I did not really have a suicide note or plan. I was in the hospital since I was found out pretty fast. Unfortunately, since it turned out to be non fatal medication, the hospital visit was not very helpful and now I feel like a complete dumbass. I really should have done more research and gotten something fatal. It was just what I had on time.What I am surprised about is my indifference about surviving. For a bit I did fade in and out, but I was fully aware that on the off chance I did actually die, I did not care. The doctors kept trying to figure out why I did not and still do not feel guilt. I am not upset I survived. I just do not fucking care. I refused to be put in a pysch ward. I have sensory overload issues and I have heard enough shit what they do to autistic people in my state.Maybe because I am in a vicious cycle of barely hanging on, I knew it was time. I do not remember everything and I do not want advice. I also do not want fake positivity of the ""oh it will get better type.""I got enough from professionals. I really do not need to hear or be guilt tripped into why I was wrong for finally being provoked into it. Therapy is in the talks but I need to find a good fit for someone who is okay with who I am. Because there is not a lot of people that like me very much (understandably honestly). I am often treated poorly by others. I do not understand healthy relationships and now due to financial reasons I can only hope therapy does not drag my fiances into the ground because I have to go if I want to make the attempt to be better.

"Hello! it is a rather long story, basically my whole life and how my parents' behavior and little comments affected my decisions in life and make me really, really sad.I am 20yo at the moment, female, but have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was 13. I am not diagnosed with depression, have not been able to go the psychotherapy, because my parents think I am joking and it is over exaggerated. Back in 2014, when I was hitting puberty, I had an awful summer where I realized everything is meaningless and whatever I do in my life is going to be forgotten and had my ""nihilistic"" phase, crying all day that I am useless, I have no friends, no one to understand me, nothing. It was rather unusual, because my mom has given me love all my life, my father was a bit on the cold side, as he stopped expressing love towards me once i started growing up and decided to raise me up as a boy and not spoil me. All in all, my 2014 summer was pretty sad, I told my mom about it and that I wanted to see a psychiatrist, because I did not feel too well, but she brushed it off with: ""If you go to the psychiatrist at 13 you are going to become insane at 30"" - its a stigma in my country to seek help from a professional about your mental health. During the years after that i grew out of this nihilistic phase, decided that even though everything is meaningless, you can still enjoy the good things in life. I still had my episodes of wanting to kill myself, end it all, being unbothrred with everything, crying over boys, broken hearted and many more occasions. Overall, I still had that ""it is whatever if I live or die today"" and it was getting stronger when i was struggling with love, when it was raining, when my parents put me down for not being the first in maths/physics competitions, had different POV from their, wanted to go out with my friends as much as they could, enjoy life, they are basically super strict and did not allow me lots of things, even when i begged. I was also not allowed to have any boyfriends till 21, no joke here.Ff to 2020, I finally decide to begin a serious relationship with this guy, even keep it in a secret, and love him and enjoy life. I am also studying abroad in the Netherlands, first year student so we keep it long distance. it is 2 months into the uni year and i become super homesick for my family and my bf, i am crying all the time, i am also struggling with uni and just cannot stand it anymore, to which coronavirus gets out of control and they let us go online so i get back to my country. My parents are happy, I am happy but i am worried how i should tell yhem about my bf and my struggles with uni. They are pretty chill, because I have lots of time till the end of the uni year so even if i struggle i can get better. Ff May 2021, my parents become super toxic, telling me how i should study, spend this amount of time to this course and doing this and that, to which i reply that i will not follow their advice because things are much different than they were 30years ago. They become super oppressive and i decide to run away and leave them a letter in which i say what i feel, that i have a bf and all the things i cannot do. I do so, and my mother just stops talking to me so i phone my father and he tells me to come back, sit down and talk with them. I do so, we have a talk with my father and he is pretty chill about the situation, they ""let me see"" my bf and travel to his town with one thing in mind - that i shall keep studying. I have no problem with that and ff 2 months, they are back on their old shit, telling me that if i do not pass my exams i can never see him, that I am not trying as hard as i can, that ill end up as a 7/11 worker, that all I am interested in now is only sex and much more things I will not write down. I scream out loud during one fight that I am fed up with all that disrespect and behavior and burst into tears and start shaking, they try comforting me but i doubt that they really understand what is going on in my mind.Today i had an argument with my mother and in the middle of it, when neither me nor her was talking she just commented ""or you are going to tell us that you are going to kill yourself again"" - like it was a fucking joke and i do not feel that way. I am just done with this shit i am so close to harming myself, i cannot stand this anymore, its been every 2/3 days, its like they just cannot understand me and just want to obey everything they say. i do not even know if it is just me and my head is exaggarating these situations or they really are causing me mental health problems, I am just tired of crying myself to sleep and trying to do my best while it still being not appreciated.

My older sister has been suicidal since I was seven (10 years ago) and has gotten worse lately. I was putting away laundry and found a sock with razorblades and a blank piece of paper. I was thinking of hiding it but I am not sure if it would make things worse since she is an adult and can just buy more. I cannot tell our parents since they have both been mentally abusive our whole lives. My mom never reacts well to these things since this is not an uncommon thing in my family (normally threatening to commit too). My sister has always complained about my mom's tactics. Would it be wrong to hide it? Would it be wrong to suggest my mom get her into a hospital? I need advice on finding a possible note,Suicidal

Having to know that she is going on them, which she is asked almost every day on a different date, is difficult. I just sit at the house with our children and try not to stay in my head. I am not over her, but she made it clear she is with me, at least romantically. She still wants to be friends for our children. Sorry for the rant. Just seems like a good place to release some thoughts. Day at a time",Depression

"I am 22 and have no real hope for the future. i attempted college multiple times but each time i ended up having a total mental breakdown where i was completely detached from reality and ended up hospitalized, causing me to fall behind in classes. I have been hospitalized so many times i cannot even count (more than 5, less than 15 times). now i work at a fucking ice cream shop and feel/look like shit everyday. all i do is wake up, lay in bed, go to work, come home super late, lay in bed, repeat. days off are almost worst than work days since i have so much time to just mope and do nothing. I have pretty much completely isolated myself from my friends and family since i feel like such a loser. all i can think about is how disappointed they are in me and how much more functional and successful they are. socializing has also just become highly draining in generali never know what to say since i do not do shit and have no real goals. the only person i want to see/communicate with is my ex but he lives three hrs away from me and left me due to my illness anyway. we still talk everyday but knowing hes probably happier without me and will find someone else only makes me want to end it all. i seriously have nothing to live for. thanks for reading i just needed to vent publicly a little bit mental illness ruined my life",Depression
"It feels like my mental health has just been in a state of constant decline since I was 12. My life has reached a breaking point and I have no one to talk to it about so I guess here I go. I have had an awful eating disorder (ARFID) since I was 3. Essentially I developed a mental block/crippling fear around trying new foods and as such I have a kind of limited diet to this day. At the time I was developing it there did not exist many studies or much information about it especially not in males. It created a horrible relationship with my parents as they were desperate for me to just get over it, but I did not have the mental capacity to understand why because I was 3. It only gets worse as you get older because you dig yourself further and further into your comfort zone. My parents tried all they could to get me over it including hospitalizing me at 15. At the time I was also starting to work out excessively and starve myself because I was being bullied a lot and was disgusted by my physical appearance. The hospital did not know what to do with me either because they had never had a male come though and they mostly just specialized in anorexia. Long story short they eventually just kind of gave up on me and sent me home and I think that damaged my parents view of me for a long time. At the same time I have wanted to pursue a career in film/entertainment/content creation but my parents moved to the most rural and middle of nowhere kind of town in america so there was not a lot of opportunity or schooling for it available. I feel constantly insecure about the fact that I really have not developed much as an artist in any particular medium but I never had anybody to collaborate or learn from/with. People I went to high school with already have big apartments in LA and I have nothing to show for myself. I know it is not healthy to compare yourself to others and we should go at our own pace but I really do just feel behind developmentally. I moved out of my parents house the day I turned 19 because I had reached a low with living in Arkansas and dealing with my parents. I threw everything essential in my car and drove to the city I had gone to high school in and where my sister lived. It was 600 miles away. I was fortunate enough to get a decent paying job and an apartment that I split with roommates pretty quickly. This was one week before the country went into total lockdown. The goal was not to move out and wind up on a film set but more so to just grow as an adult and get a feel for living on my own. I made a bit of progress with my Arfid and tried a good number of new foods for me. At age 19 I tried scrambled eggs for the first time in my life. Pathetic yes. A big step for me. Also yes. Life in the apartment quickly began to decline. One of our roommates began to gradually let more and more people sleep on the couch and they were leaving the place in a state of absolute filth. I cleaned up for a while but eventually it became too much and I was fed up with it. Around this time I was thinking more and more of moving to a big city with opportunity and a scene for either film and tv stuff or live streaming. My girlfriend is a production assistant for a Netflix original right now in Atlanta. She has been pressuring me more and more to move to Atlanta and it seems like the proper thing to do but I have my reservations because I am horrible about driving it makes me want to throw up and their public transport is not dependable and the cost of living compared to their minimum wage is pretty bad. Her parents pay her bills. Her parents knew someone to get her that job. If I go there I am likely to just be stuck at another retail grind and I am not even sure if I could afford my own place on their wages. I do not have any higher education. I started college when I moved out but it had to be online because of the pandemic. here is where things get really stupid on my part. I cheated. We were at a low point in our relationship and had not seen each other in months or even been able to communicate much because of her job schedule and mine. A coworker came to me during my last week and told me she had feelings for me and we kissed. I feel absolutely abysmal about it. Yes my life was at an absolute low I was basically just working at this retail store and then coming home to a house that looked like an episode of hoarders buried alive and smoking weed and going to bed, but I do not want to excuse it. I feel like absolute shit. At this time I am back at my parents place with a fat savings account (good job me) and my girlfriend is still being very pushy for me to move to Atlanta immediately. I will probably break things off with her tonight. I am just so tired of all the pain and letting people in my life down. I think people have been as patient as they can be with me and as supportive as I probably deserve and I just keep fucking it up. I just want to have a roof over my head, the ability to support myself and the time to pursue my passions/hobbies seriously but its all so complicated now. I am so tired of letting everyone down. I am so tired of letting everyone down.",Depression

"Tomorrow I am going home, having visited my dad for the first time in about a year and probably for the last time ever. I have a plan. I have the equipment. I have the date, even the time. I do not know what more can or will stop me. My friends (more like acquaintances) know my mental health is not optimal, same with my family life (family is not abusive or anything, just dysfunctional) but no one knows that I have thought about this daily for the last few months. I have one last therapy session before it goes down, but it is for unrelated issues, and I seriously doubt I am going to tell them anything at all. I get these tiny little moments of doubt, like right now, when I am not sure of my choice, but they pass way too soon. My only other mindset is completely decided on it. Everything is just cold and meaningless and I am over here, supposed to do stuff and plan stuff and be a good person when all I really want to do is disappear. There is not one fucking day I wake up that I wish I had not. I drift off in the middle of conversations, fantasizing about ending it. I am snappy and a total nightmare to be around. I am starting to lose my grip on reality and it is fucking hard to deal with this bullshit. Stuff is bad, and it is only going to get worse. I do not want to be here when that happens. I did not ask for this, I did not want this, I do not want this. Fuck. I do not know what I want, and I know that whatever it is, I would never be able to achieve it. I do not know what I am trying to do here. I am sorry. I hope my grandma will not be too sad. I do not think I can do this anymore",Suicidal
"I have been fighting this since I was 11. that is when my hero killed himself. It stunted me socially and unplugged me from any form passion. I am 38 now and having lived a life without passion and without the skills that develop around socialization, there is no path forward. I have spent the past 20 years failing at changing my situation I have tried to learn countless skills, but none of them have thrived. I would like to quit now. I am only really worried about hurting my young nephew unplugging him the way I was unplugged. But I cannot go on like this. I hear and see beauty in my head that I cannot express with my fingers. I workout and starve as best I can, but my body will not change. I am sad all the time. I would like the strength to be selfish. I would also like to spit in Gods stupid face.

"Sorry this is long but I doubt anyone will even read this but I just need to get this off my chest. \---I have always struggled with depression since I was a young child. On and off numerous medications throughout the years, nothing worked because, at the end of the day, I did not have things in life that brought me joy as others did. I was an awkward introvert with anxiety and depression. I fought through depression for years and really busted my but to get a good job and work up and create goals for myself to really not let depression get me. I have a great job. I am so grateful for what I have and yet.... Life. Just. Feels. Pointless. I feel like i am drifting with no direction and I cannot seem to pull myself out of this pit. Everything this I do just does not make this feeling go away. Therapy and acknowledging why I have attachment issues and things from my past doest change the feelings. I understand my past, I understand my issues, but knowing this or talking about it does not change my obsessive thoughts and deep depression. Medications never stopped my thoughts, sleeping pills barely helped my sleep. On top of my already struggling chemical depression, I feel my life has just gone down the drain of everything I worked for. Ill skip the childhood and long list of life trauma and jump to the past year topresent. Since I worked hard to overcome those....My fiance and I broke up because I walked away from a toxic situation to try to better my life. He was bipolar. Anxiety medication made me gain 40lbs (I was underweight before so this was not making me obese but it still did not feel good and cannot' seem to shake it)I have lost 6 family members in the past 3 years including my sister. My fiance told me not to bother him with my grieving because it was annoying. So i learned to just deal on my own. When I was trying to move on from my ex, my male friend tried to rape me at a party. When I tried to talk to anyone about it everyone just told me to get over it so i did and kept on moving forward. I moved my job and gave up the home I owned to be with my ex, who changed his mind. Learned to appreciate it and enjoyed the ride. I am living in a temporary apartment trying to decide where to live with no furniture bc why bother if i do not stay. Lived trying to appreciate how nice it is in a new place. I had a pay cut at work due to the pandemic forcing me to live in a cheaper place far away and now have to travel 1.5 hours to the office each way. But that is okay, more time for audio books. I did not let any of those things get me down. I tried to just find happiness in everyday things and get through. I knew walking away from a bad relationship would be hard, but that it would lead me to a better life. Things started to look up, I got a raise, I started working out daily, was really putting in the effort to say yes to things instead of no, spent a lot of time outdoors, read as many books as I could. Joined a few dating sites to keep my options open to love. A year after my break up and moving out we had a long weekend at work for the 4th. I got depressed, no friends were around, i felt so lonely and pathetic. Went running, to the pool, I got myself some nice craft beers and just started reading, watching funny movies and just tried to pull myself out of this. Even treated myself to sushi to try to cheer me up and just enjoy my time with myself. But by the final day of a long weekend alone, after many many months alone. I just broke down and cried. Ended up drinking a bit and just let it out. Felt my depression. BUT then. Random burst inside of my overwhelmed me and i said to myself...I will NOT give up. I am awesome and great and I know someone will see that. I am fun to be with, loveable, funny, I have a great career, finances growing, i got this, made a visionboard. So after 1 year of dating sites, I have talked to hundreds and hundreds of guys. I feel like I can tell pretty quickly when I click or do not, and really have not experienced any conversation of interest. I still knew id find someone but was picky for a conncetion. People told me it was because i was not open or wanted my ex, but I really was open, I just could not find the chemistry I was looking for in a partner. I really try to add to the convo and ask questions and elaborate to build connections, I am really good one on one building connections. But then... an incoming message from someone new. just another guy that took the time to write something out but the responses had so much personality to them. I started getting excited to see them come in. We moved to another chat app and starting messaging from sun up to sun down every day for a few days, then he asked me out. He was busy but wanted to make it for the following weekend. We continued to chat all day every day completely connecting on so many levels. He really confirmed he was interested in me and was so excited to meet me and was clear i was what he was looking for and everything we chatted about was deep and connected and understanding and always followed up that we were still interested. Nothing really changed and then in the second week of chatting, pics, and videos. We were writing back and forth, he usually initiated and we both continued the convo. nothing happened or was said but it one second after i respond I was left with ""unread"". Never heard from him again and it is been about a week and he never even opened the message. I sent another one a few days ago just expressing I wish him the best and enjoyed chatting and such but thought we connected and were still interested. That was never opened as well. I had not been blocked thought, maybe that was something as my mind obsessively overthinks it. Anyways, skip to a week later. I got too attached to someone I never met. I was walking on air excited to chat with someone I was so into. We talked too much it honestly felt implied we would clearly be dating after meeting and that was just a formality. I get it, I was stupid to care before the meeting. But I could not help it. I was still chatting with others to not put eggs in a basket but no one had my attention as he did. It felt easy and effortless. I took a break from online dating to recoup and ground myself. Obsessive thoughts consumed me. What happened? what did I do? He was so reassuring and thoughtful. I could not sleep for a week. I could not control my thoughts of failure after a year of trying after my fiance and i broke up. I stared at my computer all week watching emails and emails come in with no desire to respond. Depression has taken over. I decided to take to reddit just to let my feelings out. I am finding work so pointless. Making money for what? To be alone? I had a few friends, they were depressed too getting out of bad situations as well and trying to find love. All of a sudden LAST NIGHT. I HIT THE WORST LOW continuing into today. My friends have all left, two found new fresh love and are on the moon with joy after barely anytime being single (inspired by how happy they saw me talking to that guy) and they took to themselves and found people quickly and enjoying their start and really do not want to deal with depressed me. I was the one being so optimistic to them, telling them they got this and really trying to radiate positive energy. I am happy for them I wanted to see this as the universe showing love around me as if it was close for me too....but the universe slammed me with the same day, another death. Another male friend cut me out because I told him that i did not see a romantic future with him and he kept trying to manipulate me to want the same things. It got ugly. My ex reached out saying he wished he could have loved me but just does not and does not know why he cannot care about me but wished he could. I got so low, made a call to everyone on my phone list that I talk to, and no one was around. I went for run. Talked to a shrink who told me just to meetup with someone and get out. (that is always the advice) No one was around. Walked for 4 hours straight. Called a psychic just to give me some hope, something. Just ended up making me feel worse. I am now sitting on my computer writing on reddit drinking whiskey out of the bottle realizing that I am defeated. I think my depression has won. I tried to overcome all these situations, better myself. \*\*\*Now I am realizing i feel more depressed a year out of my toxic relationship than I ever felt in it. Wishing i had it back because this feels worse. I cannot get myself to work. I am distracted in my mind all day every day. I cannot make myself leave my bed. I feel left behind. Like everyone is moving along and no matter how hard I try. I keep getting kicked. I stare at the ceiling for hours on end. Everything I tried to do to stay positive came collapsing. Donated some money to some charities. Tried to volunteer but I get anxious in groups. Bought some nice things incase I got a date, to make me feel good. Did a juice cleanse to boost my health. Increased my exercise. I was going to my apartment pool, gym, anything to get myself out and about. At this point now. I cannot even get myself to watch tv or a movie, cannot read a book, cannot work. Every time I get a mere boost of energy to be positive I get more news that brings me down. Staring at a phone checking for that message that never comes. The psychic told me to change my energy. I feel like everything I do has failed and I am in such a dark place right now. I see loneliness or the company of people I force myself to be around since I am an introvert and do not connect with just anyone. I cleaned, I decluttered, i did all these positive things. Even feng shui and crystals around the place to create good energy. I thought I had the light at the end of the tunnel after that long weekend, but now, i am at such a low i really cannot get myself out of it. I do not even have those small moments of pulling it together to clean or shower like I did before. I will probably get in trouble at work but I wish I could care but just do not. Happiness should not depend on other people, i know this. But what do you do when nothing brings you joy. I was happy alone for a while, i liked myself, i saw myself as a catch and worthy of love. But now, I just feel kicked and defeated as nothing will ever change and all the men I like do not want me. The men I do not see a connection with romantically try to hurt me. or manipulate me. If life is settling, what is the point. If all there is work and exercise. I just do not see the joy in life. I give up. I am really really sad right now. I feel my life is pointless. Like is life really just holding on every day? There has to be more than just holding on. I was able to work through a lot of things but now I do not feel it. I do not feel like life gets better. I just feel defeated and at the lowest darkness I have ever felt. I overcame things for what? I feel so dark and low. Thanks to whoever is reading this and letting me vent this, long annoying rambling. I have hit my lowest low in life as of today...I just give up",Depression

"A year ago, I used to talk to people and express myself pretty easily, and whenever Id say something the words would not feel fake, or they would mean what I would say. But ever since school started, last year I have become a husk of what i used to be, I cannot really motivate myself to do anything at all, especially communicate with others, I used to have an urge to talk to others and try to be funny, but it feels like I lost all of that, I feel hollow constantly, and I do not have any personality anymore, whenever I am on call with someone it feels like I am just pretending to be an interesting person, and when I run out of things to say, my mind is empty, and I just sit on call in silence, trying to desperately think of something interesting to say or hold onto. I am talking to this girl and I feel like she is losing interest because of my nonexistent communication skills and its hurting me a lot, I have lost my personality pretty much, I feel like a robot or something trying to imitate a human.

"Searching is not a cry for help. This new practice of tech companies creates more stigma and increases feelings of isolation. Also, the National Suicide Prevention hotline hangs up on people all the time. Failing that, people who feel like they have no place to go are immediately met with the same after school special cliches their friends and families would kick out. That is not help or hope. It is ridiculous and inhumane that there is no pathway to communicate with people who look at suicide in a rational and open way. It is never framed around the person in pain. It is always about the repercussions of their actions, which removes the agency of the person considering such an act and casts them as a mere accessory or novelty in the lives of others. The fact that I cannot use the word suicide in any search engine or social media site without being bombarded with anti-suicide propaganda is oppressive",Suicidal

"I got fired from my job of 5 years in November. It was rather sudden and unexpected. In March I got a job but the hours were not what I wanted and my anxiety was through the roof. I quit before my training ended. Beginning of June I got real sad and decided to apply to a bunch of places got 2 no's. Got a call back for one but I was out of town and unable to make the interview. On our way home I got a call from another place to go in for an interview. That one I was able to make. It was group interview a little nerve raking but I thought I did well. They did too. Two days later they called for a second interview. I went into that one and did well, so well I was offered a higher position than what I was expecting and at full-time which I was also not expecting. Of course I said yes. But now I am not sure if I am ready after all. I started yesterday and it went well. But I am scared I will not like it or that I will let them down and not end up being who they thought I was when they hired me. Or that if I do not like it I will be letting my wife down.

"long story, but here I go (please do not mind my grammar mistakes or if things are said randomly, I dropped out early In my life) I grew up in a really poor family of five, living in a small two bedroom apartment in California. the bedroom was shared by my brother, sister, and I. my father was mentally and physically abusive to my siblings and I including my mother and I realized it when I was 8. it was a really harsh realization at such a young age and it honestly makes me feel like shit knowing I never had a childhood because my parents would never let me outside or have friends over. as I grew older, I realized that I had to grow up early so I always tried my best at everything, tried to get the best grades I could, tried to make friends, tried to be social with people, but it all failed and that is when it all started. I was maybe around 14 when I first started sneaking alcohol and weed I found in my parents room and god it fucked me up so badly.my body could not take any of it, especially the alcohol but I kept coming back to it because I found it to be a temporary escape.soon after, I dropped out due to failing grades and behavioral issues which lead to my worsening downwards spiral.now it is been a couple years and my father died due to heart failure and other complications but I never felt any kind of sadness twords his death, I did not go to his funeral either because I could not bear to look at him. however, all of those feelings I should have felt are now coming back and I feel like absolute shit because I feel like even though he want abusive, I should have built a relationship with him.I spent my whole like being jealous of everyone who has a happy relationship with their fathers and it really fucking pains me to know I never had one with mine. my heart is racing because I am not use to opening up to people but, it is the internet so why not? I have lived with depression and anxiety my entire life and it is been eating me alive it feels like. nothing makes me genuinely happy anymore, not even my cat or my boyfriend of three years and I am honestly thinking of ending it all. I have cheated on my boyfriend and I hate admiring it. it was around 5 months into the relationship when I did it and I honestly feel like shit about it still and I cannot get over it. I hate knowing that I have hurt someone that I claimed to love so badly. it makes me want to end it all. I use more than weed now too, and it makes me feel worse.

"Once I had depression 3 years ago, the reason I wanted to kill myself was because suicide was the only way to get out of the pain that I was fighting. Nowadays, things have changed. I want to live and avoid pain but I must kill myself because I found that I am the very person that meets conditions of a man whom I want to kill.There are several things that help me realize that I must kill myself, but in summary, it is because I could have been a better person in any aspectbetter job, better human relationship, more money, and a lot morebut I have not tried and I will not try. 3 years ago I compared myself to others(mostly my schoolmates who already graduated and got jobs), but now I compare myself to 'the better me' that I could have been. The counselor I met when I got depression for the first time told me to compare myself to 'the worse me' in the past rather than others; but it seems like to work in the wrong way.One major symptom is that I call myself as a third person in my brain. When I swear at myself I do not think like 'Why am I such a shitty ass' but 'Why is John Doe such a shitty ass'. Feels quite weird, when someone insults me and that guy is also me. Of course it is painful. And logically, I have no reason to stop swearing because my father told me not to harm others and I am not one in that 'others' so swearing at myself is not harming others. Not blaming my father tho, for he is the best man I know. I am just abusing his lesson.Of course I have a dream of a happy life in my own way. This is what throws me into a deeper pain because every time I dream of it I found that I will not be able to get.As I wrote in the title I do not want to die and I know that no one truly wants to die.

I am so goddamned proud of you.Maybe you went to work and made eye contact with other people and had lunch with a co-worker and saved all of your tears for the ride home.Maybe you waited until your kids were asleep before you broke down.Maybe you cried in front of your daughter.Maybe you locked yourself in your bedroom and looked at memes.Maybe you had too much to drink and texted your ex.Maybe you listened to so many Jason Isbell songs that those ugly tears falling all over your face turned into mascara streaked catharsis.Maybe you hid under the covers and watched Netflix and did not see another soul.Maybe you hid when you heard your doorbell ring.Maybe you kissed a stranger at a bar. Maybe you went grocery shopping and wondered why everyone else looked so much happier than you.Maybe you clung to your cat.Maybe you fell in love.Maybe you moved on. Maybe you ate too much even though you feel like a worthless piece of fat shit.Maybe you did not eat at all. Maybe you got up and brushed your teeth.Maybe you did not.Maybe the only fucking thing you did today was stay alive.Every single word of what I just said means that someone showed up.You showed up and lived your fucking life in spite of the knot in your stomach. You lived. You participated in life.And where there is life there is hope.Stay cool. I see you,Depression

"I am a failure. I failed my mom, I failed my dad, I failed the girl I liked and most importantly I failed myself. I use to be in this sub to understand others, maybe I will build some empathy and love myself more or at least forgive myself for my mistakes. I have always tried to do good, I swear. But life keeps fucking me in the ass with no lube. I try to act normal, go out with friends, work harder, learn new things but I feel everything is just an act. I still feel empty, with no clear path to follow. I am just a tragedy. I never noticed it but all the signals were always there. there is no time during the day or night I feel painless. I am really trying but fuck man it is as if God or idk who the fuck is in charge (assuming there is someone) is just making fun of me, making my struggles bigger day by day. I am young, in less than a year I would have graduated from a top tier uni and hopefully things will improve. But is not the prospect of a better life that keeps me from harming myself. But that of my family, friends and her. Most of them do not even know what is going on. The ones who know kind of understand and tell me that it will make me stronger. Thing is, I am so tired of being strong. I am just weak and pathetic. The idea of doing it keeps popping in my head, but I will keep fighting. If I decide that is is not worth the fight anymore, that I want to be a coward and do not care about my love ones. Here is the proof that I do. I care more about them than I care about me.

So I have been off it because it was just too expensive for me to buy. I have been feeling horrible and just angry and pissed off. I take full responsibility for my actions because it was not the job but me. I could not get myself motivated enough while at work so the shift supervisor was critzing my work. I was getting upset and arguing with her and anyone else who was trying to help me. I was not even sure how long I was going to last, to be honest. The boss pulled me into her office yesterday morning and informed me she would had received too many emails about my behavior. I was told I needed to change my behavior or I would be fired. I just started there on June 21 and I already had too many complaints against me. My heart nor my head were into the job and I decided to quit. I already knew I would not make it.

I have no reason to suffer as I do, yet I live on. Is it masochism? Stupidity? Guilt? I do not fucking know.

"I have had a problem with building **intimacy** for **years** now. I have had a problem with cheating. I have had a problem with **obsessing** over my partner. **Becoming** my partner that I cannot focus on my likes and dislikes. I have **2 failed engagements** and **cheated** on **everyone** I ever been with in some **form**. they are attractive **people** and for the most part **sane**. All **older** than me by about 4-9 years. I **realized** I could not keep **hurting** people I **loved** or **claimed** to and I began self-improvement (not a fan of that word). I took time to learn skills by taking leadership courses online, learning Arabic, serious fitness training, trading securities, Biblical studies, competition running, cycling, significantly increasing my income and helping my family etc. I did not involve myself with a partner for about 1.5 years neither relationally nor romantically.***More Background but not relevant:***I reached a point of what others may consider ""success"". I purchased a rental property and had enough in liquid funds that I do not worry about living expenses as much as I use to. I felt disciplined and in-control but also like something was missing. I have youth, energy, but lack time as I know it will end one day and I will age. I see myself as an observer and do not attract many people socially. I have not put much effort into (romantic or social) relationships most of them have gravitated towards me. I do not know if it is my stare or my looks but I do know I struggle expressing myself verbally at times. Most of the people I tend to avoid are those that bring aggression or some form of untreated resentment. I cannot tolerate a whiner or someone who believes they are better than someone else because of something material or circumstances they had no control over.***Boom COVID and Quarantine:***I realized the world is not meant for solitude and I craved interaction even if it was meaningless conversation about weather. I met a person online that I felt comfortable with going steady we saw each other casually for about 8 months before I proposed something steady, I told this person about my past and trust issues. Childhood, etc. I have been in a relationship with this person for about 10 months now and my thoughts are re-surfacing. I find myself of scenarios that play out and then start feeling as if they are true.***Adding color:***I work from home and I go to the gym every day after work. During work I could be focused on a task and once the task is complete my mind does not know what my partner is doing and it bothers me when I do not receive constant communication. I do not want to be needy anymore. I find myself thinking of driving to where they live to observe them just to check they are not cheating or something. I find myself thinking of entering their social media pages to read messages etc.***My ask:***What can I do to lessen these thoughts and let go? I tried prayer, I tried meditation, I tried learning hobbies, focusing on myself and being okay with being cheated on. I do not know what else to do as it is becoming a constant pattern in my relationships. So much so that I do not know if I can continue my current relationship without hurting the person without intentions but through my thoughts becoming reactions.tldr; I choose to cheat on people I love and get annoyed with putting up with them after a certain point. I focus on the initial stages a lot but then have trouble with my own likes/dislikes that I start adopting their likes/dislikes and get depressed.

"I was a good kid all my life. Never got into any trouble, got good grades, was doing what I was ""supposed to do"". High school was the highest point in my life! I was the conventional smart kid and got into an alright university. I thought college would be great but instead I started losing friends (mostly because I did not keep in touch as I was always ""too busy""). I made several acquaintances in college, but just one of them is close enough to me to call a friend. Now that I will actually be graduating college, I have realised I have done nothing but waste my 4 years. I spent 4 years feeling sorry for myself for getting into a ""bad university"" (which it was not as bad as I thought in my head). Now here is everyone graduating with one of the best jobs this world could offer for my stream and I am here feeling sorry for myself. I stopped taking meetings with the companies that were actually interested in me because I felt I was better than that. I feel like I did everything right, and I even sacrificed friendship for this career and it did not seem to work out as well.Now even the companies like the ones that I refused to talk to will not respond back. Every morning I apply to a 100 jobs and get a shitty automated reply a week later saying how they do not want to hire me. I cannot afford myself any longer. Moreover I do not think I would have any respect back home going back as an unemployed person.Four years ago, I promised my mom I would help her move to bigger house after I get my job. But 4 years ago, I was a smart kid (at least in my head). I have not graduated yet. And by the looks of it in the time I would be, I probably will be unemployed and without friends. I cannot go back to my old friends without seeming like a freeloader who talks to them only when in trouble and I do not think I have to face to go back the same small house my mom always complained about saying ""hey look mom, I am unemployed and useless"". The pandemic certainly has not helped. Even if I do get a job, it will probably be a shitty job, given my condition now, where I will just be a cog in a machine from which I would probably less than a few pennies.

No one's getting anything they want. everyone is just smiling and lying through their teeth about how happy they are while they are sad people just one incident away from jumping from a cliff.

"27yo Male, good life experiences including backpacking Vietnam, visited Paris and Barcelona, enjoyed cities like Nashville, Boston, Montreal, Scottsdale, moved to FL with my gf at 25 on a whim.

Also do not assume the people that appear to be in good places, really are in their mind, we just bandaid our problems with stuff to hide our problems from ourselves]I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life, as early as 3rd grade I can remember pitifully trying to strangle myself with a balloon string (sounds silly how unrealistic that was looking back). I have tried ecstacy a handful of times but never in conjunction with peaks of depression and anxiety. After almost 8 years in the car business which definitely worsened my depression/anxiety significantly, i left to explore myself and start my own business which really took a toll on myself. This worsened since I took myself off of buproprion and sertraline 5 months ago after losing my insurance. Recently my girlfriend and I decided to do some ecstacy with just us at home, it was extremely therapeutic in regard to my mental health. There are 100% health downsides I am sure to this, but for my extremely infrequent use I am not worried about the downsides. here is how it helped me.To describe my mental health state prior to, I felt very empty and constantly in fight or flight. I have very little enjoyment in anything and found myself breaking down and crying more often to a breaking point. Why was I breaking down and crying? Because I felt so guilty thinking how badly I wish I could just disappear and how unfair it was to tell my sister who just had her first child that I did not want to be there to watch him grow. Or to tell my girlfriend that i do not want to start our life and family together because I would rather be gone. To clarify, i do not want to hurt or kill myself. But i cried even harder because I also was so destroyed realizing that the only answer is to stay and feel so empty and useless for the sake of everyone else which meant a life of pain for me. There was no winning.When we did ecstacy it allowed me to feel again (assuming a Seratonin pump) and it allowed me to appreciate. I was able to hold my girlfriend and just feel joy, feel how much she meant to me and how much i enjoyed her presence. It allowed me to remember what made life worth living, what happiness was like. I was able to work through all those thoughts inside with a fresh palate and an open mind. I was able to address things with myself that i was afraid to address. Think ways that I have not been able to for a long time. I had a shit eating grin the entire time and just felt so alive again. The next day was even better because it was a much lesser baseline but just enough to get through the day with the ability to feel good. Eventually the euphoria went away but my mind was at ease. Just because the ""high"" stopped, i was still able to work through my thoughts with myself and affirm my reasoning for being around. Unlike other drugs, you will likely remember your experience from ecstacy and similar drugs so that you can take away your thoughts with you. All in all, if you are in a very stuck place and unable to crawl out, i honestly feel a controlled experience like this may be good to let you revisit your life from a new perspective again and reason your way out of your hole. I am curious to hear people's opinions on this, either for or against. Happy to answer questions as well. Anyone use Ecstacy while depressed? My experience.",Depression

"Hi,I am in a rough place right now with no one to turn to, so here is hoping typing it out will make a difference.A bit of background: I am nearly 30, and I suffer from anxiety and depression. My natural response to my anxiety is getting lost in my computer - games, movies, Reddit.. When I am distracted I am not anxious. So I isolate myself. As the anxiety creeps closer, I close off to the world. I spend all my waking hours in front of my computer. I do not go out, not even to shop. Isolation and depression are the best of friends, so any motivation to do even the simplest stuff goes out the window. I do not cook. I order junk food, because cooking is too much. So I sit on my ass and get fatter, hating myself more and more, knowing I am in a vicious cycle, but feeling absolutely powerless to help it.Now, I know the last 18 months have been crazy, but I would have isolated myself nonetheless. So, things are not going great, but last week they went from bad to worse. I became homeless. I saw it coming, but sadly my area has a bit of a housing crisis. I could not even get a spot at a homeless shelter.So, as you might imagine, being homeless with crippling anxiety and depression, having only been outside twice the last 18 months, that was a bit rough.Luckily I managed to secure a couch, but having no family and with friendships having been neglected, due to my isolation, it was a very close call on me sleeping on the streets.Today, I got my new apartment. 250km from everyone and everything I have ever known. Unable to yet secure transport for my stuff, I am sitting on the floor writing this and I will be sleeping on the floor for the next while.Reality has caught up to me and hit me like a ton of bricks. As I am sitting here on the floor contemplating just how much I fucked up my life, it all feels a bit hopeless. It is so hard not to have a single person in your life that you can rely on.So here I sit all alone. Feeling like the biggest loser in the world and without even a bed to crawl into and try to forget my problems. What do normal people do when they get this sad?",Depression
"I am at my wits end. I grew up in a broken home, parents who physically fought and abused drugs and alcohol. I was abandoned by my parents as a teenager and had to look after myself and meet my physical needs from the age of 13 - I had no one to give me love and emotional support - for that I turned to unhealthy habits. I grew up hanging out with a bad crowd and we were taken advantage of by an adult we should have trusted. I have made terrible decisions about people I let into my life because I was not shown what a healthy relationship was, I have witnessed my best friend drown, I have lost countless friends and family members before I even turned 20. Yet, somehow I climbed out of these dark holes, I am nearly thirty and still learning how to take care of myself - adult things that no one showed me. I studied at someone of the top universities in my field, have experience career-wise so am able to get a job to feed myself and put a roof over my head. I have travelled extensively and currently live abroad - my friends often express their envy of my life. But the thing is I am miserable, I am tired of it all I want the memories to leave I want the pain to stop. I have been to therapy but the memories do not go they are still there and I do not want them anymore. I figure I have two options to end it all and forget - or pack my backs live a life free from any worry - these options feel like two sides of the same coin for me. Because if I end it all I might as well ignore the all-consuming anxiety that takes over my life. I am so over it. I just wish I had a better start in life instead of continually being dragged down by my blacken-heart. Life has been hard and I want to forget it",Suicidal

"Two days ago, I had my first mental breakdown at work because I was blamed for everything for a mistake which in my opinion was not my fault, crying for 15 minutes (at home, homeoffice)Let me summarize what happened. I am a sales (not manager) guy, and I am in charge of pricing and getting orders from my customers and especially maintaining the situation for new/R&amp;D projects and its sample phases. I have one senior (manager) colleague from purchasing who is in charge of purchase and she is responsible for preparing stock. So we have to (unfortunately) keep in touch and work together as she needs to know the project situation from my customers and prepare stock accordingly.So, in beginning of this year, my customer gave me information of the material list and that SOP is scheduled for November 2021. The lead times for us to prepare is long (40+ weeks), thus my colleague keeps asking me if she should issue orders to our suppliers. As I did not want to go for any risks, I warned my customer about the lead times and said they should release firm orders to us, so I have a commitment and know they will buy the stuff we prepare. My customer kept saying the list is still not finalized but the list would go to the forecast soon and release order soon and they are aware of the lead times. I explained to my colleague to only order if we have something firm and she agrees, and says she would wait until the list of items are in our customer's purchase list/forecast in their system.Still, in mid of 2021 we still have not received any firm orders and I kept pushing my customer every week. The only reply was, that orders will come soon. Then, last week I received feedback from my customer that the list got smaller and only 4 of the 10 original items are needed (Still no order from customer). At the moment my colleague told our director that we actually already issued order to our supplier (to my surprise) for the 10 items and I am at fault for now having dead stock because I am bad at managing this. Furthermore, She kept asking and harassing me why the customer did not release any orders despite SOP is November. I told her I explained to the customer many times and they said they understand the situation and will wait with the lead time. Furthermore, it is not our fault if the customer does not release orders when we explained them many times the conditions. Well, she did not care or give a fuck.So after that my colleague harassed me for being bad at this job and managing poorly and being fault for having dead stock now (SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASES TO OUR SUPPLIERS!!!!), she of course snitched and complained at out managing director and blamed everything on me. Because I am quite the small fry compared to her in the company hierarchy, the director at first believed only her story and continued criticizing me. Every try of me to explain that I told her to only order when there is commitment from customer, and that we did not know the list of materials was still pending until last week, was seen as a poor excuse. My director looked for reasons to blame me, such as it was also my responsibility to oversee what is ordered and to tell the customer they need to buy our stuff if we already prepare that for them. When I tried to say we should not have ordered at the first place which is her responsibility, I was just shut down.After that I just hoped to die with my 30 years instantly. I was just frustrated of everything and wanted to cease to exist and cried in the corner for 15 minutes.... I think this is what we call power harassment in the office and I guess I was the victim... Never felt so miserable but I think this is unfortunately quite common in work life. I am at this company now for 4 years and I realized the senior purchasing colleague is a bigshot because she is good at maintaining her juniors low and never letting anyone overtake her. She keeps all the difficult work for herself so that no one can replace her. So unfortunately, even if she has problems with some colleagues, she is not easily replaceable.Today my superior helped me and we had a 2 hour meeting with my director explaining what I did for this project since 2020 and made clear that I never supported the idea to order stuff without commitment from customer. Thank god, after that my director believed me and said he will check why our purchasing team ordered the stuff....But still, I still feel miserable for being blamed and that senior colleague from purchasing of mine will for sure continue to do so next time and blame everyone for little mistakes as long as she benefits from that...I used to be such a motivated man when I started working, now I just realize how fuckup this worklife can be....

"i genuinely cannot remember the last time i was actually happy and not tired. everyday i wake up exhausted. i can sleep for 8 hours and ill still be exhausted after i wake up. if i go to bed at a normal time (around 3 or 4am) ill only be able to sleep for about 3 hours and ill wake up at 7am or something similar to that. then ill try to stay up for as long as possible but feel so fucking tired! if i go to sleep earlier than that, say, 10-11pm, ill wake up at 2 or 3am and will not be able to go back to sleep. what is even worse is I am in the middle of a move, i really do not want to go because its in the middle of nowhere. i wish my dad would take custody of me or something. on the other hand, i have to watch my 21 year old brother who has autism and is also mute. my parents failed at raising all of us children, especially him. he cannot function without someone, he cannot do something as simple as sitting in the living room without sneaking into the kitchen to raid everything he can find. they never taught him how to communicate. i hate that its all on me. I am the third parent. my dad was raped before he even turned double digits and is stuck in the same mindset as he was when he was raped. my whole childhood was my mother chasing after my sister who was trafficked, on drugs all the time, even just running away from home. i wish my mom never had us stupid fucking children when she has even said herself she does not want to be a parent anymore. i felt abandon by her. before someone says anything about therapy, i have tried and tried to get a therapist and have had them before. i was doing outpatient, i think it was, they would take me out of my house to walk around, try and help my anxiety by going into stores and talking to the cashiers, stuff like that. my mom did not like that at all, she would say that they are just babying me. I have made it such a habit to not open up whatsoever, especially to my mother, and when i do TRY to open up, i feel disgusting and cringey saying how i feel. i try distancing myself from people because no matter how someone speaks to me, i always get irritated and feel like i could punch a whole through the wall. living with my mother would be an absolute fucking nightmare and I am seriously thinking about killing myself either before i have to move or when I am there. I have told her so many times how much i do not want to go and she will not let me stay with my father. I am sorry about how shitty i typed all of this and i probably sound dramatic as hell but none of you know me so I am okay with thisi guess. extremely unorganized rant about how my life is going.",Depression
"I do not know if some of you remember me, but I did a post a few days back here -&gt; [Can we talk about the less obvious symptoms of depression?]( summarized now all the symptoms you have written down in the comment section. Why I do it is because for years I was beating myself up for those less obvious symptoms, because I was not aware that it goes hand in hand with depression and thought I was simply mentally and emotionally weak, compared to everybody else. Since I had this epiphany that it might be directly associated to depression, I understand my mind much better, which I find to be helpful for myself. This leads me to have more compassion for myself and knowing, that this is not necessarily who I am. It has often been pointless trying to solve those problems (which I was trying to do for years), because as long as I am/was depressed, there was literally *nothing* I could do about those less obvious symptoms. it is like working hard for having no results, and then hating myself for not making any progress at all. So I hoped to help some of the people here too.Disclaimer:This list does not serve to be self-diagnosed and many of the points do not have to have anything to do with depression.Again: these are the LESS OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS. So for example sadness, exhaustion, numbness or lack of appetite are not listed, since those would be the better-known symptoms.&amp;#x200B;COGNITIVE ABILITIES* Memory loss * Reduced focus capacity* Problems with learning * Catatonia * Less intelligent* Inability to read* Derealization / Dissociation* Negative change in executive functioning EMOTIONS + FEELINGS* Indecisiveness (even for the smallest and less important decisions) * Shame / feeling embarrassed* Guilt* Bitterness* Irritation / anger* Anxiety* Impulsiveness * Frozen (emotionally, mentally and physically)* Restless * Overwhelmed by the smallest things (emotionally, mentally and physically) SELF IMAGE* Low self-esteem * Self-loathing* Everything is my fault* Loss of identity * Fixating on physical appearance * Consistent and relentless negative self talk* Self-doubt* Imposter-syndrome PHYSICAL* Sexual impotence / asexual / very low libido* Insomnia / sleeping issues / sleep deprivation* Lack of hygiene * Losing sense of taste* Gastrointestinal symptoms * Physical aches * Physical discomfort * Headaches / Feeling like an anchor pushes on your head * Sensitive to noises * Acne, hair loss, lower back pain &amp; irregular periods (&lt;- this could be symptoms of something else, e.g. hormonal) SOCIAL* Lower social intelligence * Not being able to handle criticism * Sensitivity to rejection* Grudge holding* Decreased ability to read social ques or properly display emotions * The need for company + not having energy to be social* Wanting people to know(or notice) that you are depressed / the need for compassion* Envy of people * Not wanting to be a burden to others isolating* Hating people / misanthropy * Being rude to others OTHERS* Burnout * Overthinking* Complaining* Remember all childhood experiences and overanalyzing them * Identifying with depressed famous people and romanticizing own situation and wanting to put own negative thoughts into artwork* Never being in the moment* Not caring about the future* Exaggeration of own bad situation Comprehensive list of the less obvious symptoms of depression",Depression
"I have been trying to tune into how i feel more lately and i cannot stop thinking about one thing in particular - it is usually assumed that suicidal folks are more likely to attempt/commit when they are at the lowest point in their life, and, i mean, it does seem logical. but what I have also noticed is that when I am at my lowest i do not really think about it, and instead i think more about how i wish the pain was over and similar things. but when it gets a little better and when I am back to not doing things on autopilot, that is when i start thinking about it. and it causes kind of a dissonance because i feel better and the situation is better, but at the same time i want to just end it all more than ever. like, for example, I am done with school for the summer, i got a job offer recently, i have not had a flare up in weeks (got a chronic condition), I have made a lot of progress on the book I am currently writing and I have been catching up on a lot of shows and movies - long story short, i have a lot of distractions. but at the same time i feel like absolute shit and every time i go to sleep i hope i do not wake up, and when i do wake up, i think about how much i want this to end.is this how other people feel too? how do you deal with that? usually the go-to advice is to find distractions, but what if distractions \*are\* what is making it worse? when distractions actually make it worse",Suicidal

This person publicly read my written thoughts out loud, right in front of my classmates, then started to preach about being kinder to each other so that this does not happen again. She did not name me, but she never reached out to me later or ever.It was a cry for help, and she grandstanded instead of helping at all.

"So as we all know, sleep cycles get kind of messed up when we are unwell. I am currently on summer break from school which is making it really bad because I just have not had to do anything during the day. While I am coming out of an episode, I have not had energy to do most things, including go downstairs, or stay down long enough to do much. Which, leads to the main problem here. I do not eat enough. *This is not on purpose.* Despite being depressed, I do not have a problem with my body most of the time, and generally do not care what is going in my body or what it is doing. Anyway, I started to notice that when I am down that I am only eating like once a day (usually crap), which has led to a host of physical problems. My hair is falling out (more than usual), I have even less energy, and I have had a constant pit in my stomach for about two weeks. I know the problem, I know how to fix it, I just cannot find the energy to do anything about it.How can I make myself get up during a depressive episode?

"Hello guys, I am here to make a rant about my work culture and having confusion for my future.I work as a account cum admin clerk at a hardware shop. A 8-5 job on Monday to Friday and Saturday from 8-3. My work used to be just doing paperwork and giving assistance to my supervisors. Making receipts to customers,making payment to supplier, filing documents and so on. On the last few weeks my job workload increased a lot, my supervisor and boss keep calling us to do counter sales job because they are being too busy making delivery orders and invoice,or should I say my boss is does not want to hire new people even though we are understaffed.At first I am fine, but when it goes on and on I realized I had no time for own work and started feeling burnout every day.Every morning when I woke up, I literally had anxiety going for my job. I keep stressing out about things they are going to go wrong in my work environment and having fear going to work simply because I am just too tired waking up every morning stressing out over the same thing over and over again in order to satisfy this company's lust and needs.My boss also keep adding work to me which includes calling me to learn POS system because he wanted the counter sales more self-sufficient and making sure the money in drawer is tally with our system. But I know nothing about the system, I try to ask my colleagues about the POS system and no one wanted to help me with it, they are all selfish people who just want to complete their own job without being bother by other people. I do not know is this the chinese culture or not but every senior in my office seems to be lazy and do not want to care a bunch about others people work even though they are supervisor of their position. This is not included in my job descriptions when I first entered the company and makes me felt puzzled it too.My boss also wanted me to create a KPI system for the company in order to maintain good work ethics and making sure everybody voice got heard. But from what I know and see that, this company workers have frequent complain over the years but my boss just would not care a thing, so I exactly do not know what this kpi system is for and I had no time for doing it also.I had think about quitting the job more than a few times already but I am afraid I cannot find another job because of it.I am just a 20 years old male where I had no chance going to college Because my family is not rich and they also having a concept of ""only work will makes you Rich instead of study""My mum being a little bit considerate saying that even though you want to go to college who going to pay for your college fees?I am kind of puzzled now for my future, I saw all my friends having a plan and a target in their life.

"I am a female and 20 years old. I have been hiding a secret from everyone for a long time and it is the reason why I think about death everyday. Nobody knows about this, not even my parents know how bad it is. About 2 years ago, I found something on my vulva which looked unfamiliar. I had to go to the hospital to check it. It turns out that I had 2 cysts on my clitoral hood skin, and they had to be removed because of possible malignancy. The surgeries did not go well. First I was quite shocked, because it looked a bit different, but I might could have lived with it still. But then, around 5 months after the surgery and when the doctors also told me that everything healed well now, I got a random scar infection out of the blue. Now I have a quite significant scar on the right side on my clitoral hood. My labia minora and clitoris were left intact but because of this, I cry everyday. The whole experience was so traumatic I got pretty severe PTSD. I cannot even talk to a psychologist about it. People on dating apps have called me pretty and what not, but I always backed off when they asked for a date because I thought its senseless anyways. I do not want to tell my story to everyone I get intimate with since its pretty traumatic, and who is still going to like me with all these scars? It just looks horrible in my opinion, I feel like a monster when I look at myself. I am just doomed to die forever alone. Since this happend, I fantasize about death everyday.

Sometimes my feelings are really really strong and i feel like i cannot control them, my mind gets filled with negative stuff but I have always tried to see the positive side of everything. I rly do not think I have any reason to be sad or depressed, I really am happy with my life and the people I love surrounding me.But sometimes out of nowhere, without reason or for really insignificant stuff I suddenly feel lonely, like no one cares about me, deep down I know that is not true, but idk why it keeps getting to me every now and then. I am an overthinker, and I have tried to change that for me and the people i love bc it has brought me problems all my life, this past year i have calmed my anxiety and the way I worry about stuff, I am feeling a lot better. But something I have never told anyone in my life is how these negative thoughts come to me sometimes, as if I am not worthy or just do not deserve to be here. it is weird, I just feel like no one would understand, idk if it is actually depression or just random normal sad thoughts. But I do not want to tell anyone I care about bc I think it would worry them and that I would destroy what i have with the people I love, that they would think I am crazy or something and leave me, that they will get tired of me. i just try to ignore my bad feelings and see the positive side, realizing that my reasons to be sad are not valid, but it is hard and i do not think i have depression but sometimes it comes to my mind that maybe i have and do not want to admit it? Idk I just do not want ppl to change their view of me or how they treat me or make them feel guilty for what I feel randomly, but idk if that is just making me close off, make a barrier with everyone instead of facing what my heart feels...

I usually watched new shows at the end of the day to make me feel good and its been working but all of the sudden I just cannot feel happy or good even with my favorite shows. I am not bored of it or its not like its bad I just cannot find the happiness I had before when watching them and its so frustrating. That was one of the last things I can do to make myself feel good and it just all the sudden does not work. I know this is such a small thing because its just a show but that is where I was getting so much joy I just lost every bit of interest in one of my favorite activities,Depression

Just always at the back of my head and seeping into every single fucking positive rush I have. Even when I feel happy, I just know that happiness will go away really quickly.

"Just to adress this: I have not been diagnosed with any mental illness. Though I have been showing major indicators of depression and anxiety disorder since quite a few years.I came here because lately I have been feeling very prone to hurting myself. I have cut myself before, the last time is maybe a month ago. I do not have very strong urges or motivation to hurt myself, I just occasionally think about it. That is usually when my feelings have been ""gone"" for a while and it feels utterly terrible to exist. But a few times now lately when I have thought about it it has been really really bad and its scaring me. It feels as if my brain is taking over and telling me to just do it finally. As if I needed it.I do not have huge issues with selfharming, I am not in great danger of hurting myself. Currently its just that these bad thoughts come to me and I hate them. Usually I can overcome them when playing videogames with my friends, so that is good.But does anyone have advice on how to actively fight against those thoughts? Or just ways that might help me with reducing or bettering those thoughts? Thoughts about selfharm, How do I cope with it?",Depression

"Why am I just never good enough? I had a pretty depressing and neglected childhood. My brother was always the favorite kid and anything I accomplished never mattered. If my brother even got 70 percent, my parents would literally treat him like a prince and if I got the same marks or more in fact I never even got single praise out of their mouth. When I was about 10 years I had to relocate to another city only because my brother was in a boarding school and he was very homesick. I was homeschooled for 2 years and no one cared about me. A real example, when my brother was in 10th he got about 68 percent in his board examination and he was sent for a trip with his friends because my parents were proud, and when I was in 10th I got 93% and I did not even get a well done or I am proud of you, it was just okay, why did you get fewer marks in science. I recently got the presidency for 2 departments in my school, and when I told my mother she just said okay, can you fucking believe it, just an OKAY.

"The last couple of months has been hard for me mentally. I was always a fully motivated and positive person, with a ""never give up"" and can-do attitude, who was treated as a ""role model"" by my peers. I supported many friends when they had hardships, yet when my world is crumbling, I feel left alone. I read articles on how to deal with my depression, regain control and stay positive, yet during days like this, I am unable to do anything, just staying idle in this weird state of being empty, which is frustrating. So far, every time I have had this state I just tried to survive this mood until the next day or a better moment, however, recently I feel like I am running out of energy to do so. I am slowly tired of trying and failing again. I just need to share my problems with someone else, but not related to me, so I would not feel embarrassed showing my weaknesses. Even drunk I am not able to open up, trying to maintain the perception of me being strong and firm. I am 26. 6 years in a relationship, last 9 months I spent abroad doing my MSc, hence my long-distance relationship drifted apart, which probably is the main because of my anxiety and lack of control. It was always my safe haven, which now is sinking. We made plans that in sept-oct this year, we will graduate and relocate to a different country, be engaged and start building our own family. Now, my gf is not sure if she still wants to be with me, does not see me as a future husband and lost her love. We decided to try and rebuild this bond, but it causes me a lot of stress and anxiety when she is wavering, while I am doing my best. it is killing me that I cannot do anything, but wait and be patient. I struggle with my dissertation topic because I just do not feel it. I hate the ""research and academic"" way. I would like to make something practical, instead of just referencing existing research and doing interviews... I am running of time, yet my supervisor is not helping me, instead, he put more pressure on me, that it is my fault and others are doing great...BSc in engineering, MSc in Managemet, a lot of academic experience, but lack of real working experience (just side jobs, which are not related, volunteering etc.) and I wasted some of my time just having fun with friends, games, and so on. Now, I am keep being rejected even though, I do my best with my CV, personalised cover letters and assessment tests... I wish to finally start my career to be fully independent from my parents, but since COVID-19 and being MSc student I did not have a real chance to get a job. Next month I will go to a warehouse as in the past (mentioned side-jobs), but it is frustrating that I am a talented person, career advisor is saying I am fine, while I am still being dependent and unemployed... Due to being abroad, my old friends turned away from me, having their new friends, work, families etc. Meanwhile, my parents are telling me that I should be strong and my depression and problems are exaggerated. Basically, they ignored my feelings. I feel a little bit better now, saying this out loud (thanks!), although I know it will not change anything in a long term... I am losing control over my life, which slowly pushes me to suicidal thoughts.",Depression
"Dear all, \*\*Background information\*\* I was diagnosed with PCOS in November 2019.

I am optimistic for someone who struggles with these thoughts as often as I do. I just feel stuck.

I used to be able to sleep hours everyday to pass the time and I cannot anymore because I work full time at a really good paying job. No job= no home and I cannot do that to my son.

"I am 21 years old, 22 in September. Until I was about 17, my life was in perfect harmony. Good grades, happy relationship, excited for the future.But that did not last. My dads alcohol addiction finally overcame him, despite multiple attempts at rehab, and he disappeared for about 2 months before being found dead in an apartment. he would basically drank himself to death. And then, the next year, my lovey grandmother - who Id formed a very close bond with following the loss of her son/my father - also passed away, from an unexpected and aggressive cancer. After that, everything just went south. I became short-tempered, angry at the world. The relationship I was in ended soon after, and worst of all, she found someone else after just 2 weeks (bearing in mind wed been together for 2 years at that point). So I went to university, hoping that getting away from home would be a sort of reset; a new start, so to speak.Nope within about a month I was smoking weed, popping pills, and living every self-destructive fantasy I could think of. It was fun at the time, a nice release, but in the long run it was anything but.Fast-forward to next year, the diagnosis comes in: Post traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety and depressive disorder. And I have now blown almost all the money left to me from dad on cigarettes and drugs.And to top it all off, I failed uni. So I am now poor, unemployed, and realising that I have gone down EXACTLY the same road as dad did. Like I did not learn anything from watching his mistakes.I do not really know where I am going with this, to be honest. I know that I am to blame, and nobody else. But I just felt like I needed to get all this off my chest.Thank you to anyone who took the time to read I am not suicidal or anything, at least not yet, just looking for some guidance honestly x I feel like I have made so many mistakes in life",Depression

"A ramble, sorry. I have no friends, no family, no life, no job, no hobbies, no money, and most importantly as of right now, no health insurance to get better to possibly get help to fix myself to have these things. If I cannot get therapy or medication or psychiatric help then nothing matters. Everyone throws around get therapy when someone is struggling but not everyone fucking can, so stop telling people that, its infuriating. A huge debt and hospital bill will probably make me want to die more; so? I am paranoid all the time, I cannot stop analyzing every single thing to death. I do not think right anymore. thought negatively for so long I believe it. I do not think people can change, I try and try and I keep going back to how I was. It has to be untrue that you can get better because I have done so much and I am not. I am miserable, I am sad all the time. I do not care about life. do not care about even finding something enjoyable to do because I just do not care. I do not care about any of the things everyone else cares about (family, career, hobby blah blah blah) I do not believe in purpose or meaning because we are just a bag of cells, some hyper intelligent apes that just run around a world that tells you how to live and defines you based on looks, money, success. I am extremely self conscious and insecure, I have tried every single thing to fix this and actually for once like myself but you cannot do that if you actually do not like yourself, can you force yourself to like someone else? No. So why should I force myself to like myself when I literally cannot because I am hideous and disgusting and getting older. We used to not live until we were 30 before modern medicine and such, but now we are prolonged to live until we are seen as worthless. Ageism is a thing. I have suffered with anorexia for 8 years, I was abused and neglected as a child and then abused again at 19. I am 22. I miss being young as well, I hate that I am 22 and I do not want to age anymore I rather die young than die old pissing myself in my diaper and being alone. I never leave my house, I hate people so very much. They seem selfish, dangerous, and I cannot relate to their minds because they operate correctly and mine is going a million miles a second. I think deeply about thinking deeply. I am scared and anxious so much from everything and trauma its physically effecting me. I am fatigued and sleep and act like I am sick. Maybe I am sick but cannot afford any medical care!!! I hate my body, face, hair, and skin. I hate my personality, my voice, my thoughts and thinking patterns. My family is gone or have been the reason of how fucked up I am. My friends hate me and moved on years ago. I only have a SO and they are why I am here today. But, my insecurities and jealously is ruining that too. I am not good enough in so many ways, I am so miserable its showing up everywhere and again there is no help for me. I cannot even afford sliding scale help or any of the fucking rest. My sleep is not even restful as nightmares haunt me daily and make me wake up so so so sad. God, I wake up sad every day. My body hurts, my heart is broken. I just do not want to live here anymore but I really do not want to hurt my SO, but I have been so strong for so fucking long just for my SO, but I cannot take it anymore I cannot do this anymore and I cannot breathe because of how much I hurt. Nothing can help at this point I am seriously too far gone. I cannot function at all, I cannot socialize. I do not want to live poor anymore because I am too anxious for work, I do not want to live. I do not want to die either I really fucking am scared and terrified of death but the pain I feel the aching dull feeling of despair in my stomach is just too fuckingr much right now.

I have had depression for 8 years but it feels like I have issues that stem from earlier. Even as a child or entering into being a young teenager, I never experienced real aspirations or ambitions for the future. I was always told that I had not found my calling yet. I cannot help but feel that is just impossible for me though. I do not think anything can bring me fulfilment. Nothing has succeeded in doing so, whether it is time with my friends, family, romantic relationships, academic or workplace accomplishments. The things I have, or the things I accomplish do not provide me with any sense of pride, nor do they inspire me to aspire for something more in the future. I do not know what to do. I am so exhausted continuing like this. I feel like my brain is fundamentally flawed for the human experience and that there is no way for it to change.

I do not know how to live a normal life and follow my dreams through this pain. I feel like just having to live is me being strong enough but having to do real shit is too much..,Depression
"I have fucked up badly. I made so many mistakes in my life that it is all flashing before my eyes. I have made one lie because I thought people did not care about me and it backfired so badly. I lost friends, I lost people who cared about me, I lost so much. I just keep losing. I may only be 21 but I feel like life is not going to get better. Every time I think my life is ok and going good, something always happens and it is never positive. I do not know what sick game God or whatever higher power is doing this to me. I have always tried to be good, I have tried everything. To go to therapy, to getting on medication, to trying to have better ""coping"" mechanisms but it is just not working. I do not know what else to do. I looked up ways to kill myself but those stupid articles keep telling me there is hope. How can there be any hope? The world is burning, the government is terrible, and I keep fucking up. I understand I am human but I do not want to keep making human mistakes. I know me ending my life will make people if any that care and love me will be hurt but I want to do this so I do not keep disappointing and letting them down. I guess they will be disappointed they could not save me, but it will only be a moment. Everyone dies... I will be forgotten in a few months anyways. I guess this is just my suicide note. I am sorry for all the hurt and pain I have caused and going to because. I cannot be forgiven for any of my mistakes. I deserve to punish myself and if that means my death than so be it. I do not want to die but I have no other options. I do not want to live as a an empty useless husk. I do not know what death will bring but if it means to end my suffering of this life then so be it. If anyone that knows me finds this reddit post, I am sorry for being a failure and letting everyone I know down. I am sorry for making more and more stupid choices. I am sorry for lying. I am sorry. I am sorry that I am a terrible human being. I am sorry that I cannot get better. I am so sorry for everything... I will make sure I do it properly and all the way this time so I do not keep lying about my attempts. I want to be remembered for being brave enough to pull the plug, regardless on how many times I have to do it to accomplish my new goal. I do not want forgiveness or pity. And if anyone finds this post and tries to talk me out of it, I do not believe any of it. I am sorry... I want to end my life",Suicidal
"Today, i have come to the sea side for my sister's wedding. There was a lighthouse at the furthest part of the bay. I just felt i have to go there everytime. For five days, I went to the lighthouse and thought just thought. We were preparing for a wedding but i was depressed and feeling lonely for a reason. Today's visit was pretty harsh with too much wild thoughts. Eventually i found why i was sticked to that lighthouse. Two years ago, I was at my highschool graduation party. Whole class whom are graduating was only 50 to 60 people and so everybody knows each other. After the party has come to slow music for dancing, i was just shy as f*ck to dance. For other impacts on me , i was actually the first one on exams and everybody knew me for a reason so, i was not the guy nobody cared but the one who was cared. Anyway, i was there standing some people trying to raise me to dance but i am rejecting for some fckng religious reasons. I got my seat next to my friend who also did not come up to dance. The neat part is here which is still I hate myself. For the 4 years and some before the girl i loved was there just sitting maybe hoping for a dance. But nobody did not tell her. Maybe this was the chance for a last moment i would see and maybe know her but i could not. FOR FCKNG REASONS! i could not do it. I was shy and idiot. I knew that this love was not just a simple thing but to write poets and think always. Maybe it is creepy for 4 years i did this. But as i said, some religious things blocked me. Also, i was preparing for University exam and i was scaring that what if i cannot succeed in the exam for this love. I had pressed my feelings deep inside but they have never gone. That day was the most crashing moment for me to remind me why i am a failure and idiot. Today, because i am in my sister's wedding, people are going to watch me and of course i have to raise someone to dance. And my cousin who looked liked with her face and hairs just like my love. I am not pervert and i know she is my cousin but my love has never passed away and i still remember her.So i will raise her to dance today and i will cry as fck inside for that old day. Well, this seems simple for some people here but that lighthouse and sitting there alone watching the sea reminded me that I have succeeded in the exam but this life i have put my everything is not what i can go for a life span. I do not know how to enjoy life. I have wasted my 4 years and only thing defines my life is my successful exam. Everybody knows me because of my University. I am disappeared behind my success. And this is my fault. Not raising my love to dance is my fault. Wasting my life for chasing money is my fault. I was just looking the sea to jump in and never swim up. I am living in a body not doing what i wanted but only chasing money and career. Two hours ago, I had a choice to make. I could jump in and disappearing from this world for good. But i had another chance to change my life maybe. Maybe I cannot say this was a desicion because I do not want to ruin my sister's wedding. It would be pretty selfish. Anyway I decided to not wait or hesitate myself to do anything. I chose what my life should be. If you have read this whole, thank you. Now maybe, you can talk to your loved ones. Just go and ignore anything. Not doing this, will ruin your life for a long time. A Decent Reminder",Suicidal

"I am single and never been in a real relationship out of the fact that that idea of commitment scares me and I have not met anyone that i feel comfortable enough to say i date them. Recently I have had a string of recurring dreams of women whether I am close to them or feel an attraction to them whether its a genuine connection or sexual pleasures varies but one thing is the same, i wake up and am saddened. After each one of those dreams my first thought is, it was a dream huh?. Although it is also my own fault since my inability to know fact from fiction in my dreams is addictive like being in a VR game where I am happy until i take the headset off. Deep down i find myself craving those dreams and try to lie to myself like i do not just so I do not think about how pathetic i feel. The truth is I am so alone and it scares me. Opening up to people personally is extremely hard since just like my choice of love interest, I am picky with who i talk with. Its easier to think of it has having certain levels of access. My closest friends having the highest access to my feelings and thoughts while everyday friends barely have access to what i want them to see of me. I have not had a close friend since early to mid highschool which was a few years ago and without anyone i trust enough to be a close friend I am stuck with my own thoughts trying to figure out how to feel. For the longest I thought id be fine, i did not need anyone else but truth is my own mind is eating itself alive and bit by bit I am losing parts of me and it will only get worse. I cannot stop it at this point.

"Right now I am in lockdown at Sydney and lately I have been feeling really rough, all my hobbies are being pulled from under me end am house bound like the rest of us my girlfriend is terrified of the virus and we agreed to not see each other until lockdown ends since we live in different areas and do not have any to risk anything. The last week she went a little quiet and I asked if everything is ok and she is come out saying she is second guessing being in a relationship as she likes her freedom of being on her own but she loves spending time together but her introvert personality does not know. I reassure her that I am happy to go at whatever pace she wants she just has to be honest and she brings up that she was never looking for a relationship on the app and did not expect to meet someone she likes this much. I never told her I have feelings for her just that I really like her and care about her, and she said because she is confused she feels so shit since we have feelings each other but the prospect of being in a relationship makes her uncomfortable right now. She asked for my advice and I said look right now if we end it it will not make sense, you just said you have feelings for me how about we continue to see each other after lockdown and of something happens it does. She agreed and stated she wants to try instead of just giving up. She lives on her own so I am thinking the anxiety and loneliness might be getting to her and she is a little in her own head? Even though we have been dating for 5 months I really like her. I have had a rough 3 years dealing with family loss, getting made redundant from one job, my business I started before Covid doing well then failing due to the pandemic, dealing with toxic relatives over an inheritance.

"Long post incoming. Sorry, it is kind of a cry for help.When I was a kid, I was reading books like a madman. I distinctly remember the time the 6th volume of Harry Potter came out, and I stayed up all night, managing to read the entire thing in one sitting. I am 24 years old now and would absolutely not be able to accomplish such a feat. Years of sitting in front of screens and allowing that dopamine flow have wrecked my attention span. I get easily distracted by the smallest things while reading a book, constantly having to re-read paragraphs, ultimately getting frustrated and putting the book away for ""later"" - and a book that should not take longer than a week, takes me at least a few MONTHS to read.I struggle with studying, too. The entirety of school was easy for me and I did not have to study that much, so naturally I filled that time with video games and the internet instead. Since I was a shy, introverted guy filled with social anxiety who did not really have friends, I had tons of time to waste in front of the computer or the phone. By the time university came, I was in no way prepared and disciplined enough for it, I did not have a work or study ethic. I ended up wasting my time, dropping out of 3 different majors (Chinese studies, law and computer science) because they ended up not feeling right for me, and me lacking the attention span and perseverance to try my best. I still do not have a degree despite being 24. I am starting Sound Design this October, since I have determined that I am interested in music and sound and would like to pursue that as a career, but I fear my lack of focus will because me to fail that as well.Nowadays I am working in an office, where I naturally have to be in front of a computer for 8 hours, then I go back to a lonely home where I am going to sit in front of another computer or my phone until it is time to sleep - day, after day, after day. it is a job which barely pays enough for me to sustain myself, saving up for traveling, which is what I dream of doing, is off the table. I am lonely. I do not have a girlfriend, I do not exercise, I am overweight (not obese though), I barely spend time on any other hobbies. I could be amazing at playing piano and learning Japanese, which are two things that I am interested in, if only I was willing to spend as much time on them as I am spending on video games and watching stupid bullshit on the internet. But my stupid brain refuses to actually focus and I cannot get my shit together. I have tried making a change reducing my screen time a few times, but it always falls apart after a few days tops.I need help.

"I mean why. Well you will die anyway someday, why you could die now if you want ? Why it is considered bad and insane.

Then why you cannot kill yourself just for nothing? Even if you are not suffering much. Just like i do not know as a form of shame. Like i just do not understand why is it that big deal. All humans will die anyway someday what does it matter if you die some years earlier or later. All times it was ok to have honourable death. Let me have it. I just see it now optimistically and not negatively. Like you fuck up, you die. I do not know how to describe it but i see it now very optimistically. Like i do not suffer that much, but still want to die for all things i fucked up. I see it as relief, as a salvation from all fuck ups. I know i will sound like a kid but it feels so cool for me. Like the same feeling when you watch a movie with a ""tough good guy"" as a main character, who even when he is tough, he has his code ( like do not kill children, do not stab in the back, give a chance do defend himself etc.). Like those codes seems cool. This thing feels like a code for me too, so that is why it feels cool too. Why is it bad to kill yourself",Suicidal
"Hello Reddit! I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language. Any sort of advice, words of kindness would truly help. Thank you.I have made a post on this account before, and writing my feelings out made my pain feel a little more bearable, so I hope this does the same. I was born in a typical central European family with a loving mother, a slight narcassistic father who I dearly love and my two older sisters. My whole life always felt a little bit misplaced. My school grades were always very good, and I was reading quite advanced books from an early age, which had some consequences like; growing up too early and costant boredom at school because I did not get enough of a challange. My social life had been very poor, and I was getting constantly picked on which resulted in a low self-esteem and depression. I was eleven when I first tried to kill myself. I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for about six months, and finally got off anti-depressants last August. (Two years later).This year has been very tough. After I switched schools I have met a boy who I had feelings for and for the first time in forever, I felt truly happy. After being friends for eight months, he lead me in the woods and took advantage of me. Things have not been the same. It took me three months to hug my mom after that. I never told my family, but I did tell my closest friends. It hurted seeing him laugh with his friends, living his best life while I was sitting at the back of the class holding in another panic attack. But I can always remember who was always willing to take a walk and let me rant about my feelings, spend some silly young times together and take on the world like it was ours. It was my best friend, neighbour and someone you could call a blood-unrelated older sister. She took her life a month ago, on the hill we used to make memories on.I wonder where she is now. Dealing with her death has been a very tough experience I cannot describe. Some feelings words just cannot get a grip of. I am celebrating my fifteenth birthday in five days, and I still cannot believe I made it this far. Maybe I do not have a will to live right now, but maybe my point of living is to find it.The stars shine a little brighter now that you have joined them, Ana. My best friend took her own life",Depression
"As the title says, I am losing the battle rn. I need help. Honestly just knowing I am not the only one in this mindset is a little comforting. Bc it scares me.I am pretty sure I have had mild anxiety/depression(Atypical depression maybe even?)most of my life( I am 18) and just recently went on medication for it 2 months ago. I have always had rejecting thoughts in social settings, hurt high school friendships, and not until I finally sat with myself to accept SOMETHING is wrong with meI need help. I am sorry if this went nowherekinda how my mind is. Sprawled everywhere.Does anyone else just not give a single fuck?? Like..I know if I do not change my ways it will only hurt me, but I just have no will to live. I do not want to live, but I could not ever tske my life knowing the consequences, and pain it would bring on my family. I do not even talk to my family..Why is death all I think about.?No dreams..no aspirations..just want life to be over.Please tell me I am not alone LosingTheGreatDepression",Depression
"I despise everything about being alive, despite that the concept of death shakes me to my fucking core. I have had suicidal thoughts as long as I can remember, but death still freaks me the fuck out, which is the only think that keeps me from ending it all. I do not want to keep on living, but the fact that death is so permanent and and an unknown feeling freaks me out so much more. So I guessing I am bound to keep on existing until its finally my time. I just hope it happens suddenly so I do not even know what is happening. God I wish death was not as scary as it actually was",Suicidal
"Last week I slept with a married couple (I am a man) it was my first time receiving anal sex. We wore protection for anal and vaginal but not oral. I did not feel comfortable giving head without protection but it was expected of me anyway. He came in my mouth unexpectedly which I really did not want.They told me they would happily get tested if I requested it, but that was before I slept with them. Now that I have asked them to get tested they are ignoring me and acting like its a ridiculous thing to ask. The guy was gross, I felt disgusted after sleeping with him. I only did it because his wife is a 10/10, I have no idea why she is with him. This entire experience left me feeling like I am not bisexual after all.I have told my friends I had a really bad experience last week, but men just do not give a shit about things like that. They just make jokes to try to ease the tension. Made me feel like shit. And I am too ashamed to even suggest this experience to my female friends.I hate myself for this, I am worried about my health. I have had a sore throat ever since we hooked up and am going to get tested next week. But HIV and hepatitis require you to wait 12 weeks for an accurate result.I feel used and dirty. I hate this couple, they are such bastards. I have no outlet for my frustration and I can feel myself spiraling. Had a bad sexual experience and now really depressed with no support system",Depression
"I have been extremely suicidal from a young age. My depression is biological, so I have had it since birth. I did not expect to live past 14, but I kept going. I did not expect to live past 16, then 18, then 21. I am almost 22 now and I feel the life being drained out of me.I never had a plan for my life. what is the point of preparing for everything when I was going to end it all anyways? You could say that I have friends and family to live for, but my only friend abandoned me and my mother is controlling and has narcissistic tendencies, and would willingly sacrifice me for her own comfort.I have no savings. I am in $2.5k credit card debt. I cannot escape my house and I do not have friends to room with. I feel like I am left with the option to end it all or sell an organ or two to make ends meet. I am so fucking miserable that even playing video games or just looking at fucking cat pictures makes me upset. Why am I goofing off when I could be working? What have I been doing with my life? Why have I spent so much time fighting?I am just so exhausted. I skipped meals for a whole day recently because I felt so guilty for wanting to spend money. I am tired and I want the pain to stop I have never had a future, and will not have one now",Depression
"Ok so, since my last post I have been doing fairly good, up until tuesday.. WHEN I FELT AMAZING! I got a ball python, his name is Chad Slithers, hes amazing cute, and aslo amazing. I am doing so much better and therapy is helping a lot. I do not ever think about suicide so I am feeling really good about things rn. Love you all! I am feeling better!",Suicidal
"I am barely holding on. The only reason I make it through each night is because I tell myself that the option to kill myself will always be there tomorrow. Since I was 17 years old, I have been dealing with what my doctor thinks is narcolepsy. I sleep all day and no amount of sleep makes me feel well rested. It feels like torture. I cannot afford to get the necessary sleep study to get it treated because I cannot hold down a full time job because of the amount of sleep I need each day. I just want to die to escape this hell. I am also in an abusive relationship that I do not have the energy to leave. He makes me feel bad any time I show any emotion or express how much I am suffering. It feels like I have no where to turn. Really the only comfort I have right now is that that option will always be there for me when I cannot take it any more I get through every night by telling myself that it will always be an option tomorrow",Suicidal
"I cannot stand this world and the humans on it, people are so ignorant its insane, people are just filled with pointless hatred and act like saints when there sinners I cannot stand people who hate and jump on someone for there wrongdoings when they have done worse I have already failed killing myself twice and I cannot stand this shit, women are the most pointless and hopeless things to even invest your time to, for beings so emotional they do the most fucked up and emotionless shit ever not even men can compete with it, they ghost you, guilt trip, act like victims, get everyone on there side to go against you, shameless, cannot accept there wrongdoings and are just utterly vile things at this point there not even humans and men are just high egos,to much pride narcissistic, do not understand emotions and become shit fathers but they have a higher chance of change then women do, women change when its way to late but men do when they have seen what they did is wrong, women can be shown what she did wrong and will not accept it,the human race should just go extinct at this point truly a digusting world with such vile creatures and its only going to get worse I am so tired",Suicidal

"I am done, I have decided to delete my reddit account. I do not want to have a social life or similar any more. There is nothing for me outside of the door and there is nothing even virtually.Please be kind to others even virtually. Everyone has their problem, i know, but sometimes even a kind reply could help turning the day for someone.Find the time to be kind. There is always the time, and it worth the effort. There is already too much shit in this world, do not change it because is too late, but do not contribute either.Reddit was my only social app. From now on, i will be a eremite.Good bye. Last post.",Depression
