I recently went through a breakup and she said she still wants to be friends so I said I can try doing that but when she talks to me about things it always hurts. I just want to lose feelings so all this pain can stop it hurts so much and I cannot even cry about it. I do not want to hurt her because she said she does not want to never speak to me again but I do not know what to do here. When we were together she always hurt me so I do not know why I still love her. I wish we never met it would be much less painful How do I lose feelings?,Depression
"I do not know how to navigate these feelings, not that its a new feeling by any stretch. I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives. I do not really know what I am looking for I guess I just wanted to say this out loud, or whatever. 0 to 100",Depression
"So I have been with my bf for 5 months , and he already told me he was depressed. To this week nothing particular happened, but i can now feel hes bothered by it. He does not ask me to sleep together, do things and etcI know I am not the problem I am aware of that, I just wanted to ask: how can I be there without suffocating him? I am really clingy, a thing which he usually loves about me but right now I kind of have a feeling that I am doing too much.Any suggestion will be gladly accepted, be frank and tell me how I can not make it worse: its that that bothers me. My bf (21) is having a bad time due to his depression",Depression
"I am so exhausted of this. Just when I think I can finally rest, just when I think maybe things are starting to settle, another hurdle comes flying at me. This month alone we found out my mum could be dying, my girlfriend left me, my parents revealed that they wanted a divorce, my grandad was hospitalised again and just now my little sister's been rushed to A&amp;E with possible brain damage. If there is a god up there they must fucking hate me. it is like life is trying to get me to kill myself and honestly I think I would be better off dead. I attempted when I was 12 but I was stupid and there was no way I could cut deep enough. Now I am 15 and everything is so much worse than it ever has been and I just cannot hold on much longer -- it is going to take a miracle to get me through this. I feel so alone. I feel like the world hates me and I have no idea what I did wrong to deserve this. I thought I was getting better. I was doing so well and now everything's just come crashing down again. I was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning but I highly doubt there is any way for me to get that. it is looking like I will overdose but that is unreliable as fuck and surviving sounds like hell so idk. Just got to stick around long enough to make sure my sister's alright. I have already contacted one of my ex's friends to make sure they are looked after when I am gone. I do not think there is long left for me. Sorry. I have posted on this subreddit too many times in the span of a week and that is probably really annoying I just have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I feel sick. If my sister dies then I really cannot do this anymore. It all hurts. Life is really fucking trying me",Suicidal

I do not drink so going to a bar to meet new people is not it, i do not like party's or festivals since its too crowded and filthy, dating sites are shit since most people that are on it are superficial, and even with the rare ocasion i get a match and message them i get no response, I am just done. I have wonderfull close family whom i love alot but, i just do not want to deal with this constant loneliness, does anyone have some recomandation of wich activatys would bring me more into contact with people( i do not have any hobbies or special intrest besides my obsesive facination about war and the reasons etc) How long am i suposed to go on until the ""better"" days come",Depression

I am just fucking ugly and all I want is to find a person to love..I feel disgusted by myself that I am jealous of my friends and I just want to end it all but I just see my family's faces and I do not want to put them through this.. I feel I am playing my life on hard mode while everyone is on easy mode.. I just cannot do this anymore I am just tired.,Suicidal

"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why",Depression
"Did your depression start after a time of serious stress/anxiety? If so, this may be why you feel so disconnected. After times of intense stress, where we do not give ourselves any leeway or breaks, our body naturally will downregulate hormones to essentially force us to stop what were doing. So we may have super high levels of glutamate and norepinepherine keeping us in a stress response, but low levels of dopamine keeping us in a depression, and the high amount of anxiety neurotransmitters because us to feel both depressed and depersonalized (freeze response) If you feel disconnected from reality this may be why",Depression
I am on zoloft and focalin and it is changed my life over the past four years for the better. But this week I have been feeling like I am regressing a lot. I do not have any interest in any activities I normally like. My brain feels like there is a fog around it and I love my new job but I do not have the energy to perform as well. My fiancee went out of town on Tuesday as well which just made things worse. I feel useless and tired and just like shit in general. I think it is hitting extra hard because I have been doing so well for so long. I would talk to my fiancee but she is been through so much with me that I cannot bear to put this on her. I am just lost... what am I doing wrong? I just want to get back in my routine but idk shit sucks. it is getting worse again...,Suicidal
"I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it, but long story short, I am getting better after months of medication, therapy, etc. My anxiety is at an all-time low and my antidepressants """"do not allow"""" my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it, i hate that I am getting better, i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing, like taking a walk, laughing, or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish, i was given immense support from everyone, my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists, psychiatrists, pills, etc; she is suffered more than anyone else, even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not ""tried harder"" to get worse, but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know, get a new self destructive habit, and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes, i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months (i dropped out), i started driving lessons yesterday, I am eating better, sleeping better, I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it, it makes me feel bad, gross, EMBARRASSED, very embarrassed, and its just a cycle of:I am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do, I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get, but i guess i needed to vent, thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??",Depression

"Everyone in my schooling system thinks I am autistic but I really faked it so my school work would be easier, I stopped going to school because I do not fit in there with anyone and nobody likes how different I am, I have problems about my body I have a dent on my chest and it makes me so self conscious I cannot do anything that requires me to not wear a shirt or people laugh at me and call me an alien, I have a gf but as of recently she is been loosing connection to me since she has her bestfriend back she does not want to be my bestfriend anymore, I have some friends they are really nice but I do not think they understand me, I think that my Dad hates me because I am not the son that he wanted, I feel like a disappointment to him and my family name because I am ""autistic"" and I have not gone to school for 3 years and I feel weak because I was molested and used when I was 10. I am 17 years old. I do not have a job and I used to be a drug dealer 1 year ago just because I hated going to school, when I was dealing I was addicted to MDMA and Xanax, they have both helped heavily with destroying my views and how I see myself, I have lost all of my happy emotions the only feelings that I feel is sadness and hatred to who I am. I cry almost every day of every hour just because living in my body hurts my soul so much. I do not belong on this planet or in this body. I hope nobody feels the ways that I do it is a shit feeling, I just needed to get this off my chest. I am planning on trying DMT as I have experienced LSD over 30 times but I would just like to try it to see if it changes anything about myself and if it does not change me I do not want to live here anymore.

"I have been talking to someone who I really liked. They were a great person and we really clicked. I told her that I could not do this with her because I am dealing with so much shit in my head that it is not fair to her. She said she wanted to be there for me and I shut her down. I am scared to be depressed around other people now. My poor mental health ruined one relationship and I do not want it to ruin another. I know I am much better now than I was in my previous relationship but I am scared that I might be a horrible person again.I am scared to let anyone be close. I feel like I am just getting by daily and cannot make any real connections anymore. The ability to get close to people is non-existent because I am scared that when they see the real me, they will leave. I am trying to improve but what if I cannot, what if I fall apart again? What if I am the piece of shit suicidal asshole that I was before? I am scared to put anyone through that. I kept making up excuses for why this was not going to work out. Distance, what we wanted, culture, but truthfully I am just fucking scared to be close to someone again. I am scared to be vulnerable. I wish I knew how to not be depressed. It controls my life.

"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day",Suicidal

"Not because of death, but because she wanted to get away.I have been depressed for over 10 years and maybe this is the lowest point I have ever been to.The last few days it seems like there is been an invisible force squeezing my chest all the time. I can barely eat. I spent 48 hours with only 1 sandwich in my stomach and after that I have forced myself to eat just to be able to get drunk after I get home from work just so the time goes by quickly and I do not feel this damn pain.She was my last friend. I am completely alone now.Losing people is always a disgrace to me, but ok. I have known this friend for 6 years, and even though we had a few periods without talking, we were doing well for almost 2 years, we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time?

But I felt like even my last piece of writing, however short, was not good enough. Nothing I do is ever good enough. that is how it has always been.

"I have felt this way for so long I have always assumed it was normal- not so much that I was necessarily sad, but more often just numb? Like I never really feel joy or excitement, although occasionally (I distinctly remember the occasions) I have noticeable sense of peace that cuts through my general sense of heaviness. I am not sure if this depression, and I have not wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is. I think I am having a hard time differentiating being depressed due to an internal chemical imbalance that needs to be reconciled, or just having a natural reaction to the state of the world or events (previous abuse, climate change, corruption, realizing you likely will not grow up to be what you thought you would be, the passage of time and loss of loved ones etc), or if that is a distinction that even matters?

I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine.

"Yes. It is necessary. However it is not a cure and does not fix everything. It does not fix trauma or trust issues when they are deeply ingrained because nearly everyone in your life abused and betrayed you. It does not fix depression. Coping mechanisms only go so far. You go to therapy, you talk about it, they give you coping mechanisms that trauma, depression and anxiety supersedes. And you have to trick yourself into having a positive mindset to the point where it is toxic or invalidating or bypassing very real issues sometimes. I hate it. If you do not have love, support or an environment that is not triggering then sometimes therapy is not enough. A recent K-pop star attempted suicide and all I see in the comments are: Get therapy. She needs professional help. The presence of a therapist is only temporary. Even if they are a good one. What about being home alone with your thoughts, trust issues and depression? What about feeling like you need to be held all the time? there is no medium for that. For Christ's sakes. I am so sick of people telling people to get therapy.",Suicidal

"// general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying ""what?"" five times in a row because my hearing is going.But the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be. I want to make something of myself but I just, I cannot. I have nothing to put on my resume, I cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not! And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know! Why do not I already know basic crap! Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out? If I brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out! that is it! I cannot do anything else for the day, I am too tired! there is no way I could work or get a job like this! I would burn out after one task and get fired! I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best. I hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc. Of course they would not accept me!! What the hell was I thinking!! What kind of idiot would expect anything different!! Things are not going to get better for the NPD community, not in my life time atleast! Well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. Imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something I could not. Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go.

"Yeah, this is a question I have been chewing on for a long time. I have been in the depths before, as I know you all have, too, but even in those deepest depressive periods, I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind, it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure, one way or another, ""I am depressed."" This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression, other mood disorders, and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me, like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and self-deprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression's deception? Or are there ways to draw a line near-ish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind, but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is ""depression""? I invite you to share your information and opinions.",Depression

They say every cloud has a silver lining but none of these clouds seem to be anything but black, darkness, harsh. &amp;#x200B;Until you realize that you do not have to be here and your sight zooms out, slowly revealing my eyes and the pain they hide as you travel back behind your own eyes and see this figure in front of you, torn by war and so much pain.

"It always feels so peaceful the first 5 seconds after waking up then it all goes to shit, anyone else experience that?

I just got pussy why am I so fckin empty? I am so fckin down. And now I feel like I have used someone and they do not deserve that. I miss my girl so fckin much. My mind keeps going to this picture of her laying with me eyes closed and I am just running my hand through her hair admiring how beautiful she is. Fck I miss how it felt when I kissed her. What do I do with this energy. I cannot get her back and I am left with this feeling that clearly I cannot put into someone else and be happy with it. It just sits with me waiting till I am alone so it can Fck me up.

"Content warning: Please do not read this post if you are suicidal/prone to suicidal thoughts. I do not want to trigger a negative spiral for anyone else.I am 19M from Turkey. My family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues, I have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me. I have a very sensitive temperament, am very neurotic and introverted. I am somewhat bright academically (not a genius, but significantly above average), have no hobbies or social life. Ever since the age of 13, I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me, and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime, and even if I want to migrate, I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too, but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious, believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression, though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless, because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is, I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections, only to deduce thata) my need for approval is making me unattractiveb) I am not good/attractive/sociable enough for women to take notice of me, want meOf course nobody tells those to my face, they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs, psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating, intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I, too, can see that this is all just a competition; but some of us (me included) are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists, how they talk about ""everyone is trying to get the best deal they can"" and ""you may be miserable as an 8, since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you."" Dating is a market; and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1% as a maleI know suicide, if done right, would be the same as falling asleep, just not to wake up. I know painless ways, and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience, and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love, and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled (and mind you; I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparent)I am going to wait for my therapy sessions. I just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away. And it will not. I may decide on killing myself a year later if I feel the same way, and things did not change I am considering suicide",Suicidal
"19 years old, male, from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for 2 years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government, but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist, gaslighting bastards, apathetic, scapegoating, victim blaming, and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom, while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does, it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job, and he will use it in any arguments we had; ""I am the one who has the job, who feeds you, and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful!"" in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud, surprising, or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now, except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure, useless, good-for-nothing, and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating, abusive, and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother, she is the epitome of gaslighting, victim blaming, and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father, she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now, I have been her downpour of traumas, pain, bad memories, and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad; she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui, the supernatural, superstition, and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much; I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me, but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before, these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have, and they think everyone should respect them.As their child, I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it; father had extreme face acne, mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead, I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway ""like theirs"", so no medicine is needed. Due to it, I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the ""Pimple King"" by my classmates; I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now, I have fought and kind of got some freedom, but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house, yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do; our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer, which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something, in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises, he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because ""I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything"". These days, I cannot find anything enjoyable, interesting, or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do, but my brain just rings out ""what is the point?"" and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please. Please. [LONG POST] Someone kill me please",Depression

I was managing an exercise routine, cooking lots of healthy and fun meals instead if junk food, spending more quality time with my family, enjoying hobbies again, thriving in school, and managing a self care and hygiene routine (which was always one of my big struggles).I felt like I finally got things under control but I made a big mistake that is sent everything crashing down. I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was, but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior.

"Quick background; I suffered social anxiety for most of my 20's and went in and out of depression throughout the years. I am now 31 with no friends, just a boyfriend and all my family who I barely get along with anyway live in another state. Over the last few years I have learnt to be ok with feeling lonely and being by myself. I have learnt to enjoy my own company and that is great and all but I am still friendless. I also went through a horrible year in 2019 where I went numb to something that was happening in my relationship so I would not ""feel"" so much kind of like depersonalization/derealization. Things have gotten better but the numbness has remained. I am not sure how to explain it properly but I do not have anything in my life that is thrilling or exciting to me nor do I care to seek this out. Most people have a vice like shopping, gambling, some sort of sport or activity that gives them a rush. I used to want to travel, I thought maybe that could fill my time or get me excited but even though I have the money and could travel (once out of lockdown), I just do not care for it anymore. it is like, I cannot take the memories when I die so what is the point? I could sit in my lounge room and street view places in Canada for example so once again, what is the point?All I do these days is work, come home, click around on some sites and do it all again the next day. I barely talk to anyone online. My relationship is boring and stale and even though we could spice it up, sometimes I just do not care to. I love my boyfriend but I want someone else to talk to and hang out with. I almost have no reaction to things. If I won a million dollars or even 5, I think my reaction honestly would be ""meh"". Everyone my age is either having kids, married or have successful careers. I have never chased success so I really do not care to climb the career ladder or chase money. None of that matters to me. I am not sure what does. I cannot help but feel as if I am wasting my life away. Sometimes I wish I could have a crazy life. Sometimes I get the urge to do something so out of character to shock myself. To get that thrill. To feel excitement.God, I am so utterly bored with my life. I feel numb about most things.

"tw talk about eating disorder further downHi, sorry for long post and bad formatting. I do not know who to ask this as I am on a long waiting list for a psychologist and have no one else to talk to.I have always had problems with breakfast, mostly because I have trouble waking up and am so tired that the thought of food makes me nauseous. Before work (I am currently on sick leave) I used to force down a sandwich only because I know I faint easily. Work also helped me maintain a somewhat proper meal schedule as I had designated lunch and snack breaks, and I always had an appetite right after work.Now when I have been been home several months, eating is a massive problem. Getting up earlier than 2pm is a huge but rare success but even if I do I just do not feel like eating for hours, despite feeling so hungry my stomach hurts and my head spins. I just do not crave anything and I try to drown the hunger with water and cigarettes and occasionally save myself from fainting by eating dextrose.This results in me lying around like a zombie for hours, not having the energy to do anything, until I feel too weak to make even a sandwich without having to sit down. Basically, during daytime, I HATE eating. I wish humans did not HAVE to eat and could survive off water.But then in the evening, I often find the cravings wash over me. Not only do I tend to eat unhealthy to begin with bc I do not have the energy to cook (for example I often just have microwave food or frozen pizza), but at night while watching shows or playing games I feel some kind of NEED to have something. Sometimes cigarettes and tea works, but often the cravings are too strong. It can be anything I have lying around, like crisps, chocolate, nuts, anything. Sometimes it feels like a proper craving but sometimes it feels like I just have to occupy my hands and mouth. Not giving into this often results in nail biting instead, or even worse pulling at my toenails until they bleed (gross i know, but I physically cannot stop and have not been able to show my feet to anyone throughout my life). Giving into the cravings on the other hand makes me feel disgusting, like a grotesque emotional meat machine that keeps eating just for the sake of eating. I feel disgusted by the warm feeling I got after eating those tasty donuts, like how I sometimes feel disgusted after spending money on some useless expensive shit I do not really need but that gave me happiness for one small moment. It makes me feel materialistic but like, with food, if that makes any sense.Now I know the lack of food during the day probably is a big reason for the nocturnal cravings. But it is so hard forcing myself to eat when my appetite is not there, let alone cook proper meals. I am also very conscious about my body and feel like shit knowing that I have put on some weight in recent years, even though I KNOW deep inside that no one cares about that and that weight should not define my attractiveness. But despite this, I have never had an ED. And despite having somewhat ED-like thoughts about food, this feels like mainly a problem with appetite related to my depression and apathetic tendencies. I know that if I could just pull myself together, I could have somewhat healthy eating habits.My past therapist kept nagging me about meal planning but even when I am grocery shopping I cannot for the love of god come up with any ingredients to buy, despite being kind of good at cooking. Hell, planning ANYTHING nowadays feels like climbing a mountain.Does anyone have similar problems, like lack of appetite? How do you refrain from giving into cravings/comfort eating? How do you manage your daily food intake when depression takes away most energy and enthusiasm to do anything at all? How do you deal with apathy, the kind that makes it hard to even walk from the couch to the bed? How do you keep afloat? Because I am on the verge of drowning. No appetite during day, cravings at night",Depression

"I have posted about it several times, but here goes. 12 months ago I joined a dating website and met a Thai woman. We got on EXTREMELY well. I thought she was the one for me. It later transpired that she had 2 children which she did not tell me about. Odd, but ok. I decided to go with the flow and see whether we could make it work. Shortly after, we got into a relationship.One night I video-called her and she did not reply. She said she was feeling unwell and she would see me tomorrow. When I turned up the next day, she was standoff-ish. I saw her phone on the side so I grabbed it and took a look at her photo album, looking for the photos we would taken a week earlier.I was horrified to see a picture of her in bed with another man. she would cheated on me the night I called her. Even worse, after I confronted her, she told me it was for money. Yes, he would paid my girlfriend to sleep with him. Turns out she was on some kind of dating app and had arranged that behind my back. There were a few other guys she would arranged to see but she did not in the end.She assured me it would not happen again and she had not done it before. Turns out it was all a big fat lie. I found out she was a hooker. By this point we would already given it another go. I would got attached to her and her two. children. I would cooked for them, bought them things - I felt like a part of their family.Anyway, I thought it was all going well and that was behind us, when she cheated. Again. I saw a guy online reviewing her. Yes, REVIEWING her service(s) and he described what happened and how much she charged. I was devastated. I cried buckets of tears.Fast forward a few months and we had given it another go and we were getting along well - when all of a sudden she dumped me. She said she was going back to that lifestyle and it left me a broken man. I would loved her, forgiven her several times, I would been looking after her children. I did absolutely everything I could for them. I am just left with pain. I will not commit suicide, but the pain has been so bad I have thought things like: ""when I am gone I will not be in this pain"".she is blocked me on everything.

"I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

"I needed to get this out because I have been bottling up everything for 3 years now.I have felt horrible for the last 3 years now. I am diagnosed with severe social anxiety, Anger issues, ADHD and, autism.3 years ago I got sexually abused for 2 months. I have not ever told anyone about this and still think about it every day.The next year while on vacation I was mad and out of rage I hit a window. This cut into my artery and I almost bled out. I still get flashbacks from this and never fully recovered.Due to covid I failed all my classes because I did not have any motivation and was severely depressed. I just want for it to all be over.It feels like nothing in my life is going well. Every time I am happy because I am with friends I zone out and think about all of the things stated above.

"First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 (did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press ""off""",Depression
I do not care if anyone reads this or upvotes. I just need to ask why I cannot just be happy? Why cannot I be normal and enjoy things anymore? Why does it have to suck?

"Last year the lack of future hope, and general pointlessness of life finally got to me, the cycle of disaster, recovering from lifes shit, then being thrown another curve ball finally got to me. I made a decision one night, and drunk myself silly and tried to jump off a high rise flat building, but could not get myself over the edge. The police arrested me, got me off the building and took me to a cell. I got let out later that week, I told everyone I was just drunk and it was a mistake... everything they needed to hear to let me go.I decided that day on my way home, to just enjoy one more year of life, ignore any problems as it will not matter in the long run, and hope my life spirals downwards into such a shit hole that the act of actually killing myself will not be as difficult next time around, take the options away from myself.I actually had some good times in this year, met a girl that went well for a good few months(as far as relationships go with people that is a good one for me) tried new hobbies, Got in rather good shape due to taking up boxing, traveled to a few places I wanted to see. it is not been bad, just not sustainable. Today, one year on I am in more dept than I ever have been, I am about to lose my job due to not really being in a fit state to perform at it anymore(and quite frankly, not focusing at all on it because of the plan in the back of my head) I still have 2 friends, but I do not really get on with people full stop. This is what I wanted a year ago, and although I know that, I guess I did not think I would make it this far, and now it is suddenly here. Nothings changed, I still cannot bare the thought of going through life like this any longer. It feels like just living life because that is what is expected. But I still am scared to die.I am well aware that within basically the next 30 days or so everything is going to come crumbling down around me, it is already in motion, I have done a very good job of not leaving myself any outs. And the state I am currently in, I know I will not handle it well enough to see a way to get through any of it. I guess just hoped it would be easier this time to actually pull the trigger as it were, yet it does not feel like it is going to be. I really do not want to carry on with this stuff. But I do have people who love me who will be upset. I do want to die, but I am scared of that moment still. In a way I wish I would just happen to step in the road at get hit by a bus and not have to actually do the act myself.I do not think at this point I will ever be able to do it, but I am unfortunately very good at hurting my life in other ways.I regret not killing myself one year ago. One Year ago today, I found myself locked in a hospital cell for my own protection. Today I have still had enough.",Depression
"Hello RedditI met someone recently on a dating app, and we have been going steady for a week now. We are on different parts of the country and everything has been virtual.

I am already imagining all kinds of break-up scenarios in my head. there is this occasional feeling that he might be growing uninterested as time goes by, and the fact that my brain tends to misinterpret his every word against me is not helping.The feeling is so crippling I do not feel butterflies anymore every time we talk. I feel fear.Will this ever go away? This is my first legitimate date and I would hate to screw this up.

"I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane.

"This morning I had an appointment with my mental health doctor, along with my social worker. For about 15 minutes we went through the usual conversation about asking how things were with medication, sleep etc.I then decided to be upfront about planning to kill myself after my birthday is done with (3rd of August). They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much, it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah, needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about.

Idk if its the circumstances of my life right now or if my medication is not working.. what started this all was me kicking my sister out of my house for disrespect and overstepping boundaries, then basically my mom was supposed to go to rehab so I dedicated 2 days to try and help her get ready.. while I was at her house getting her ready some drama happened and My sister (the one I kicked out) was trying to fight my mom, so I just stepped between them and then my dad comes between me and my sister and yells at me like I was the one instigating. He backed me into a corner almost yelling and cussing at me. He never touched me, but he kept walking towards me so ofc I stepped back. And it just brought back bad memories of my childhood but not a specific one if that makes sense anyway I ended up bringing her to the airport the second day. Well something happened at the airport that was neither of our fault and she said she did not want to go anymore so that upset me and I cried the entire way to her house which was an hour. Then my cat has to have his leg amputated and its going to cost us $1000 or more after everything is said and done with his er visit, preop exam, and surgery My sleep schedule has been messed up and it gets worse everyday.

"I am 31. I was living my perfect life for 7 years. Prior to that I was depressed and felt lost in life. I was engaged to my soulmate, the one person I felt Id spent my life searching for and could not live without. We had a beautiful 4 bed house in need of work which I was working hard on renovating. I was also at university getting a bachelor of science in CGI having realised finally what I wanted to do with my life. I was a whirlwind of happiness and productivity. We were looking forward to when I graduated so we could work more on the house together, get married finally, and start trying for a baby. For the first time in my life I had lasting long-term happiness, it was beautiful. The week I graduated she told me she would fallen out of love with me and there was nothing to be done. I think my absence and stress due to uni had turned me into a burnt out, argumentative, and barely present person over lockdown. She had ownership of the house so I lost that too and had to move back in with my parents. I had so much work still to do to create a showreel and get a job and was kind of looking forward to doing it but now I have lost all passion for my work. Its been 3 months and I still dream about her every night. I lay in bed drifting in and out of consciousness until the afternoon, unable to face another day of rotting away in my parents dark spare room. The amount of daylight I waste in bed means I have to spend more of the worst, loneliest hours of the late night unable to sleep.I do not want to die, I just want my old life back, but that is never going to happen.

"Today's a bad day. And I mean that kind of bad that I thought I would never experience again. it is so fucking hilarious tbh. it is like life saying 'you thought bitch' straight to my face. Anyways it got me thinking. Ever since I can remember (like 3-5yrs old) I felt like I was not supposed to be here, like I am not a human. I do not really feel things - and I mean it. Whether we talk positive or negative feelings I do not think I have ever truly felt them. I feel nothing. I learned how to act by watching others but never really understood why people would feel e.g. sad, happy or excited. So my life turned into a LARP a long time ago. I have realized that me being happy and wanting to live is just a phase. And those phases always come to an end. And then I realize nothings going to change. And I get kind of scared. because I know no matter what tomorrow, in a month, in 10 years - I will always feel empty and disconnected and it will always haunt me. I am like a broke good that needs to be shipped back to the factory.So, I am 26 now, unemployed, a NEET, have no insurance (that is a new one, to spice things up), have no friends, been faking that everything's alright to my family for 5 years, am broke as fuck (about $1500 in debt), am unhealthy and have an existential crisis when I go to sleep and when I wake up.So, like why should not I? because I really cannot think of a good reason rn.

"I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and ""put a shelter over ours heads"". For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me "" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go"" I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me ""You are going to be a doctor so you should know this"". The only thing I know, is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them "" You should have never became parents"" or ""I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parents""My parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore..

"I have always been very introverted, but had pockets of close friends growing up. My problem is that I am bad at maintaining friendships and now I have zero friends. I am close to my spouse and kids, but that is it. I do not have social media accounts, I do not text people, and now that I am working from home every day I barely interact with anyone from work other than emails and the occasional phone call. For the last 6 months I have very little job motivation and have started to eat unhealthily, putting on some weight. Feeling completely isolated from society, I have started to not care about COVID, what is happening in the world, and so forth. I still enjoy my solo hobbies though, mostly gaming and watching TV. I only leave the house a few times a week for some exercise in the park, or for a swim with my son. I do not particularly feel lonely, and have zero motivation to go out and make friends or join social activities. I never thought I could be depressed, because outside of working hours I am quite contented. I joke around with my family, I enjoy my gaming and so on.

I have to be so careful with what I eat. Otherwise it sets my stomach of. And slowly slowly,my ed started again. Its a sneaky fucking demon. Its like someone whispers in my ear: are you sure you need to eat that,have you seen how much weight you have been loosing,have you noticed that your bones are showing more and more? Keep this up and soon you will be perfect. And with that comes my other friend. Depression. I do not want to get up in the morning,I do not want to see people,they exhaust me,they make me angry and annoyed. I do not want to do anything. And those horrible thoughts of ending myself. I just want to die. If I could just leave this world and sleep forever. The only thing holding me above the surface are my kids. How much I love them. How I could never do that to them. I could never leave them with that pain. Only reason I posted here is because I needed to get it out one way or another. I am not looking for pity or help. Hopefully I will bounce back soon.

"hello!

I am scared that I will be judged by my peers. of older people who would not even dare to listen and understand. because i know, even if they do not tell me. they will think of me as this weak-ass, ungrateful low-life.it is not normal to talk about mental health from where i am, after all.I have never once tried to self-diagnose myself, as i think i cannot look objectively at my own situation. I am aware that what I am doing is self-destructive, that loathing and ruminating all day long preoccupies me when I am supposed to be doing work. work that i do not want to do anymore. work that i want to quit forever.i feel miserable. i have for years now. being in a competitive environment (medical school) that i did not feel strongly about, that i did not feel like i wanted in the first place was soul-crushing at worst, and numbing at best. I have thought of killing myself thousands of times: of jumping from a five-story building, overdosing on ferrous sulfate pills, hanging myself, suffocating myself. sadly, like many things in my life, i never did succeed in doing any one of them. i never even attempted them. it seems that I am scared of the pain it will cost me, of how it will feel. of the possibility that I will survive to live another day with my family knowing that i tried doing it to myself. of the judgement they will give me.in conclusion, i care too much about what others think. of what they will feel. at the expense of myself. and i guess i will be stuck in this limbo indefinitely until i get better. if that time ever comes. thank you for reading. hey, you! hoping that you are just okay. i am in limbo.",Suicidal

"It sucks.I had been suspicious that they would already excluded me when on social media I saw them as a group talking about inside jokes and life updates that everyone but me knew. And in a recent post, someone confirmed that they have a new group chat.I have been under the worst depressive period ever, after doing so well in 2019, and because I was not ready to socialize and talk about mundane things with them or joke around with them, I told them I will just be with myself for a while. They were initially understanding, and then as time went on I just noticed the group chat became inactive.These are the same people who made fun of me behind my back all because I privately chided one of them (my closest friend) for being so carelessly ignorant about Covid. For context, vaccination rollout in my country is slow, transmission is highhe is living with a senior who in the past tested positive; and his sister tested positive for Covid twice too (she works in the hospital). So as a concerned friend I would tell him not to go out unless it is essentialand since we have a super close bond I did not really think about me being overbearing; we have been friends for almost 20yrs and this is how we are to each other.Once during a call, he let it slip that on one of his numerous dinners out he, being the jokester that he was, made fun of me with my friends for acting like his mom. And that hurt me because it was a private matter, and now he has painted me as this kill-joy, paranoid person. And that gutted me.it is one of the reasons I started to feel distant from that group, and when they started to be cold after I told them how I would been struggling with my mental health, that settled it.I am sorry for ranting. But I feel absolutely alone. They were my closest circle of friends, top tier. And then I am shunned just because I am no longer fun to be around with.It feels like we are all in high school again when I would feel anxious or depressed, and they would choose to hang out with our other classmates who are louder, extroverted, and down to play whenever.Depression sucks.

If they divorce I do not know what side to take, but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right. I recently have felt the urge to step in myself and just tell them both to shut up and get along, and have even considered buying flowers for my Mum and telling her it was my Dad so that they would hopefully calm down or something. It sucks, it really does. I just want them to like each other again. Hearing your parents fights everyday is just the worst.",Depression
"So I am a mess, a shitstorm of you will. I am in my early-mid 40s, single, no kids, trapped where I am, drinking problem, sporadically employed, deeply depressed and a glutton for taking on other people's shit. Not a cuckold (because that would take effort into actually starting/having a relationship) but not some bullshit Alpha, just someone who does not see the fucking point of dragging anyone into my bullshit. Get the picture? I have had about 14 beers (are still going) writing this, probably the only reason for my honesty.I am living back in my father's house (explains the dryspell) having failed as a trucker and (most recently and twice over) an Amazon employee, my manager at Amazon killed my transfer to the trucking dept without a word to me and while I was ""SUPPOSED* to be covered by their ""blue vest"" rookie rules (which are bullshit as are their ""sign on bonuses"") and the job that I left for (JB Hunt) died on the vine too. there is a woman who I ""was"" involved with years ago that I still have STRONG feelings for, but I have no idea how to voice any of it. Would probably be worse if she in any way felt the same.I have been having suicidal thoughts and impulses for longer than I would admit, thinking of more than a few ways of getting it done. Pills, a nose, driving of a bridge, I have put too much thought into it.I am seeing myself as beyond any help at this point, I am mainly wiring any of this just to get it out.Probably too much text for even Reddit at this point, damn sure Twitter or probably facebook.

"I am sobbing while I write this post. I do not think I am in extremely imminent danger so I am probably not a super high priority, but if even one person could help that would mean the world to me. I never thought I would have to post on a subreddit like this. But I have had suicidal thoughts on and off for years, and it keeps threatening to culminate. Tonight has been one of the worst nights. I will try and keep my reasons quick, as I do not know if I even deserve to complain. I was born into a fairly okay situation, middle class, mostly okay family, things like that, so why am I sad? Well, I have lots of mental health issues that at least noticeably impact my ""normal"" human function, and on top of that some of my family often calls me useless because of the way they affect me. I am already in my mid 20s with a niche associate's degree my only accomplishment, I cannot find work to even be like, a cashier or something, I still live at home. No one wants me, not a job, not certain family, including my mom and sister who are the ones to call me useless. To top it all off, my dog is one of the only things that keeps me in it all the time, and now those two are threatening to get rid of her because I am almost out of money, and they think I will not be able to care for her anymore, when I would do anything to care for her, no matter how I have to get money. I need her. I have a very small bit saved up and it is all going to her while I still look for work. So tonight I picked up a knife, thought about how to do it, and... I just cannot seem to follow through. what is wrong with me? I cannot even end it right. So why am I posting at all? Because the thoughts have gotten stronger and stronger over the years, a combo of an anti depressant and therapy is not helping enough, and I feel like something is about to push me over the edge.

"I am a 27m, Pansexual, and Autistic. Growing up, I was bullied alot, but I can recall having happy moments, even happy moments with my mother, but as I grew, my mother and I started to become more argumentative and hostile, and drastically effected my mental standing. Everyday was mental struggle to find happiness, and I would always retreat to my room with my video games and anime, and it helped me ignore it, but then came the Dark Day, an argument so drastic, that I had to kick myself out, to my wife's (girlfriend then) house. For awhile, I felt great! My mother's hostility felt like the Moon from Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and leaving finally made it disappear. Come Present day, my anxiety had risen, things are harder to enjoy, and negative thoughts ruminate to the point where I cannot have a day with out hearing my mother's voice or imagining terrible scenarios around my screw-ups and it is affecting my relationship with my wife (who battles against depression, and is possibly autistic). I feeling like I am losing the war for my mind, and thoughts of running away to not bother anyone ever again CONSTANTLY creep up. This has spiraled into beast that just will not die.

"So I only have one sister, and growing up I have seen how different we are raised. As the eldest I am expected to learn all the household stuff, do them quietly and perfectly. But when my sister was at the age where she should have learned and done the stuff I did my mother never forced her to do any stuff (it is the culture but really? how fair is that?) Mom would also guilt trip me whenever I refused to do my sister's homework or project.I spotted a lot of difference as we grow older. Whenever their is conflict between me and my sister, no matter whose fault it was, they will side with her. Sometimes my father would just stay quiet because mom would get mad at him. that is why right now my sister thinks that she has the authority over me especially if I would defend or in their term ""retaliate"" to my parents. I am just tired with how things are at home.Just recently my sister and I fought, I am partly at fault because of my temper and I am just tired of them not remembering any of my preferences (they forget even the smallest thing about me.) I knew I am at fault too but for her to use the stuff that I fought over with my bf (she overheard it) during our fight is below the belt. so I told her that she has no right to use that against me. She burts out and threw things at me. She also tried to charged at me only to be held back by my mom. I do not know what to do anymore. I do not even have a safe space at home.

"Small context: To anyone who is curious I am 16 years old 1. It feels hard to express my opinion on the internet because every time I do I always get bashed for it. I am starting to doubt myself, am I the problem? What is it that I say that turns people against me? I swear I try my best to stay respectful and not offend anyone.. I swear their words get to me easily2. I hate my body and my looks so much. Literally every girl I see on the internet looks prettier than me. I see a lot of girls on the internet who do not look like they alter their photos but idk if they do.. nonetheless it makes me feel terrible to be this ugly. I cannot even look at myself in the mirror for longer than 5 seconds.. I do not even want to leave the house anymore because I hate how I look. I am considering getting surgery to fix my face but at the same time I am too scared to do it3. I feel like an idiot for being slow and not understanding many things I see. I want to be a part of the conversation but I am too afraid to ask because I might get bullied for not understanding something. 4. I suffer from a lot of health issues and most of my health problems are on my skin which makes me insecureAll of these reasons are taking a toll on me, ik my problems might not sound as bad as other problems which makes me feel bad about myself, I feel like a spoiled brat complaining about problems that might sound unrealistic, I am sorry if it sounds that way I am trying to be a better person and get over things because I am told to just get over it so I am trying but its hard At this point, the suicidal thoughts are carved into my head, they just will not go away, it feels like I could escape them for a short time if I harm myself maybe I keep having suicidal thoughts all day everyday for multiple reasons",Suicidal
"I think I have been depressed for a little over 5 years now, and as I am returning to the world due to COVID winding down in my area, I am starting to see how the isolation and negative thoughts are affecting me physically and emotionally. I finally went to get my drivers license a little less than a month ago, and on the way to take the road test I just started feeling awful, like I the weight of the world was bearing down on me, slowly crushing me. I felt my limbs go numb and the urge to vomit was creeping in along with tears beginning to cloud the edges of my vision. I have never felt as out of control of my body as I did that day it was definitely a first for me. I have never had a good outlet for all the feelings I suppress, and its awful to feel that you cannot trust those closest to you; I love my parents deeply, but I cannot trust them with the truth and it would only make them worry. Oddly I have found that self flagellation helps calm my mind, I get no pleasure from it, and I do not beat myself bloody, but pain helps me focus and take my mind away from darker trains of thought. I am going to be applying for a job in a few days and that is what is currently the main source of stress in my life right now. If I land the job it will mean moving away to pursue the work, but on the other hand I think getting away from my family and having my own space will ultimately do me some good in the long haul.

"I am just so done, honestly. The last two years have been shit, I was forced out of a job, suffered horrendously from bullying from my past two employers, have been in therapy from it, worked up the courage to get another job, my role was cut by 30 hours a week and have been looking for work ever since, I am so broke. I have been doing a course that has been extended by a year due to COVID, lockdown after lockdown. I live at home, I am not in a relationship, I feel like a fucking loser.

I cannot go on vacation, I just need a break.Today was the last straw, I applied for two jobs weeks ago. I got one of them, then they never replied for 6 weeks. I finally got a reply, they told me they never recieved anything and blamed the mess on me (I know the emails went through because they replied to me on that email address).I also applied for another job, one I actually wanted.

"Not sure if this is the right place for this or really why I am sharing.I (26 M) have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember really. The past couple of years though it started to take over my life and cripple me in every aspect. I have built a decent comfortable life with a beautiful house, a dog that we absolutely adore, decent reliable vehicles, decent job, lots of friends to go out and have get togethers with. All with a beautiful supportive wife to enjoy it with. I do not say all that to brag, just to show some perspective I guess. I have all I could theoretically want or need, but yet I was so depressed that I dreaded waking up every day. I would lay at home by myself and drink and stare at the ceiling for hours just absolutely miserable for no reason. I started to self medicate with alcohol because it seemed the only thing that helped. As long as I kept a buzz going, I felt a little better. Of course this led to a vicious cycle of alcohol making my depression worse, and me drinking more to treat my depression. I started to drink all day on most days. Not getting hammered most of the time but drinking just enough to ride that buzz to feel a little better. I could not muster up the motivation to go to work allot of days. Luckily I have a very lenient boss and a decent amount of PTO at work or else I would have lost my job a year ago or longer. It felt like the end of the world to have to get up and go to work being in such a miserable state already, so I became known as the guy who calls out all the time. He is lazy and does not want to come to work. Some days I had to get drunk just to be able to numb my head, to be able to go to work, so I started drinking before work almost every day. I had brain fog so bad that it almost felt like depersonalization disorder. could not think, could not concentrate on what people were saying to me or on a task that I had to do. My short term memory was so bad that everyone of my friends and coworkers began to notice. (I once asked a friend if he had ever ate at this new restaurant, to which he replied dude I was literally there with you yesterday.) I suffered for so long like this without even talking about it with my wife. I could tell she knew something was wrong but we never talked about it. She was always supportive to which I am so thankful for. I tried everything to try to get out of my depression. I started researching and reading books on depression and different types of therapy that is used for treatment. I changed my diet a couple of times. Cut this out or that out. Cut back on drinking. Take a daily vitamin. Natural seratonin increase pills. Started working out 6 days a week (which actually seemed to help more than anything else I tried.) All of this and I was still depressed most of the time. I would have a day or two out of the week that were good days, if you could call it that. On those days, I would convince myself that I am just being lazy about going to work and that I am being dramatic. Everything is going good in life. You have no reason to be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! I told myself this and was told this by anyone who I mentioned my depression to. I fucking hate that response so much. If I have no reason to be, then why am I so depressed then?! So three months ago is when my life finally started to change. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist, after multiple appointments made and chickening out of going. He put me on the generic form of lexapro. I am sure you guys here are familiar with it. It started to help some a few weeks in, but I was still having good and bad days. We upped the strength of the medication and holy moly, what difference! I mean, I am now at almost an entire month without one single day being depressed. I have not called out of work. I am motivated and have been doing extra stuff that I do not absolutely have to do in my job. I have been more motivated at home, with keeping the house up and stuff. (Did I mention that I let my yard get so bad that I had to pay someone $1,200 dollars to come get it back to a manageable state.) I am actually starting to feel emotions again, not just dead and empty. My wife has noticed a big change in me as well and it makes me so happy that she notices the change. That constant feeling of doom and dread is justgone, and I am actually starting to feel like a human again. My drinking has also slowed WAY down because I am no longer using it to numb my feelings. I am still dealing with brain fog and some memory issues, but I am hoping they get better with time. I guess the reason for me writing this long story, that many people will not even bother to read all the way through, is to let anyone here that has been suffering and have not tried medication because of whatever reason know to Just try it! It may just change your life. Depression is hard and it seems like no one who has not actually dealt with it understands at all. It makes you feel like you are crazy sometimes. To anyone reading this, the way you are feeling is VALID and you are not being dramatic! Good luck on your journey through the darkness all! Lexapro saved my life!",Depression

"I am a 24 yo male. All throughout my life, I feel like I ""peaked"" really early on, and either through self-induced calamity, circumstance, or a combo of both came crashing down. Even though I have not lived a long time, I already experienced a long term relationship, sex, life abroad, college, and some recognition. I realize how lucky I had been for to actually tick off those moments. But my relationship ended because I became self-grandiose and deemed myself ""settling"" for someone below me, whatever the hell that meant at the time. My life abroad ended because I forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. I have realized my BA and MS degrees, even though acquired from top universities, do not mean shit, when there were apparently thousands of software programs that I should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a ""Introduction to Beer"" GE course in college. I remember I used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three, four years ago. I always deemed it my best quality, that I could find the motivation from within. But ever since those times, I have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. I find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. I have grown a dislike for people. I think I have finally realized the superficiality of modern society, or at least the segment that I know. And everything seems extremely pointless. I have not had a job since grad school, and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. I might just have grown lazy. Or I might be severely depressed. Now lucky for the leech that I am, my expenses are, and will be for some time I think, paid for. And if I do not make some stupid mistakes, like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business, or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll, I could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society. I might grow into an alcoholic with a severed lung, but that is a bet I am going to have to make. I am not posing a question here.

I blocked him but he apologized so I am talking to him again. Hopefully it will stay civil. My younger brother is nice but does not really understand my situation. I spend all my time either at home or at the park a few feet from my house. I tried to get gas the other day but was too anxious. I drove by the gas station and went back home. My mental health has never been decent. In 2013 my physical health began doing downhill. One issue after another. No help from any of the many doctors I tried. I smoked weed every day from 12 to 18 to try and cope with my issues. When I got sober a lot of the people I thought were my friends wanted little to nothing to do with me. College was terrible. I dropped out my senior year. Every year got harder and harder since my health was declining. Then I moved back in with my parents and it was doctor after doctor, protocol after protocol. None of it helped. It generally just made things worse and Id voice this to my parents and it caused more tension. I was kicked out of the house countless times and often slept at motel 6 with the money I had at the time. I have had such a bizarrely difficult life. I have been expressing suicidal ideation since 3rd grade. I keep hoping things will pick up for me and that Ill finally reach a place where I feel stable. I have hopes and dreams. Well see what happens. Thanks for reading. All the best to you Tanner A difficult life",Depression
"I doubt I would fail if I attempted, but the idea terrifies me. I have a feeling my mom would already be gone by the time I came to, or at least very close. My best friend would lose their sober streak and probably start drinking again. I would be left paralyzed or unharmed but left with regret and I would probably just wish for death more than I do now.Of course that is not the only thing stopping me, I would feel selfish for leaving everyone I care about. I hate the idea that suicide is selfish but I feel that way to myself. I only care about two people in this world and I know they would be fucked up if I were gone. I know for sure one would follow in my footsteps and the other would probably kill themself with self-destructive habits.I just wish I could be free of this life. I wish I could retreat to some kind of void, empty of anyone else, just for a little while... I am terrified I will fail",Suicidal

"I have been diagnosed with depression, GAD, borderline personality, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. They all ass rape me on a daily basis and its unbearable.

I have no support system. I see a mediocre therapist twice a week and a stupid psychiatrist once in a blue moon. Fuck psychiatrists.I have been shying away from suicide bc my states gun laws are too restrictive and hanging myself hurts too much. Other methods are too much work. I am thinking once I move for college it will be a lot easier to purchase a firearm given the states laws and that I have no hospitalizations that would have to be on my record.

"For the last two years I have struggled with hardcore depression, which was only made worse because I feel like my life has been pretty great so why do I feel so bad. Everyone else I know has been through so much and I think they look down on me for it. I dropped out of college during my first year because of it. Two months ago now me and my best friend of 9 years stopped talking for good, and while our relationship was toxic looking back I just feel worthless. I am going back to school this semester, I have been getting into old hobbies, I have a dog which probably saved my life multiple times, and my family is pretty great. But I have no friends whatsoever. I have pushed everyone away or everyone is left me, I feel like I waste my days online and I just do not know what to do. I want to make friends so badly when I go back but she will be there and everyone else who has walked out on me. I am not medicated though I have been but I do not feel like awful as I have a few months ago. But I do feel a void. I do not ever hang out with anyone and I am just lonely. I do not feel like I have anyone to do anything with, and its been making me a nervous wreck.

You might have hope. You might not.But tell yourself that : we are thousands and thousands feeling just like you. We all have our little foggy mind of our own and we are all stuck in there and nothing each of us feels is the same as someone else. Pain cannot be compared. We all feel it differently.So even when you are alone. Even when there is no hope. Think about all the other. Who are keeping this fog at bay as hard as they can. Think about us who are struggling to survive. Thousands of us are gone.. but even more even still fight it. So do not let go.

"Not necessarily in this community, although I have seen it here before, but just in general. Someone will post in or speak about how they overcame their suicidal urges and their depression in groups of people who are all depressed and suicidal; take all the congratulations and ""I am proud of you""'s but never explain how the achieved it or give advice or even RESPOND to people asking them how they did it.Now I know nobody is entitled to anyones story, but when you dangle it in front of people who could reall use its faces, it just feels so cruel yknow? Like someone from a poor neighborhood returning to their home rich and successful and they never tell their old friends and fanily or even just people in the neighborhood who NEED it how they did it. They just stand around in the neighborhood to be admired and praised and when someone asks them how they got to that point they either ignore them or give them that same half assed vauge ""it gets better"" answer. Its good that you overcame your illness. Its good that you decided to not kill yourself or your attempt failed and you decided to live and work on getting better. Congratulations.

"IDK if this is the right sub. to post this but its one of the few that I think will actually accept a post like this and something I need to get off my chest.&amp;#x200B;Anyway, I am 23 years old and have Aspergers (high functioning Autism). When I went to college (started ""real life"") is really where my life started to fall apart. In general, from speaking to others this is a pretty common occurence for most people on the spectrum and other developmental disorders as such. &amp;#x200B;In realizing how much it impacted me, I certainly went through the stages of grief. Now I feel I am at the phase of acceptance in that I realize that there is no magic cure and its something I will have to live with. That being said, I do not side with the general Aspie community it seems with the opinion that the development of pre-natal scanning for Autism for aborting is obscene and wrong. Not only that, but I strongly encourage it. I do not think it should be required to abort them but I do certainly think that REAL education of what its like raising a kid with Aspergers/Autism is like as well as the obstacles they face. &amp;#x200B;At the end of the day, there are VERY few parents who I think can properly and effectively parent a child with it. I even tell my parents that I think you are good parents but not good parents for me (AKA somebody with Autism/Aspergers) but that I do not blame them for it because it should not be expected of them. I do not think the parents should be stigmatized for it but at the same time its not fair to the kid.&amp;#x200B;Not to mention the world in general is admittedly not structured for those on the spectrum. I guess you could argue that its possible for some to adapt but at the end of the day I do not really see the point of knowingly having a child who you know ahead of time is going to immensely struggle to blend in society (hence why I encourage abortion in most cases). &amp;#x200B;A commonly asked question I see is why do we only ever see children with developmental conditions advertised/in media. At the end of the day, its because adulthood is almost always bleak. ""Institutions"" are still a VERY real thing. Lower functioning Autism, Down Syndrome, mentally retarded, etc. kids are still very much sent off when their parents no longer can/feel like taking care of them. I know the common belief in society is that the handling of mental illness until recently was very poor and everybody was just institutionalized, well, its the same thing now. The only difference is that they can live their childhood at home and with their peers before being sent off. &amp;#x200B;Conditions like Aspergers are not much less bleak. Most are able enough to not be sent to an institution but most companies outright refuse to hire those on the spectrum, the unemployment rate is ridiculously high, many jobs require skills Aspies do not naturally have. Most end up in poorly paid jobs reserved for those with ""disabilities"" or doing something else of little respect. I am actually personally looking into doing sex work.&amp;#x200B;I certainly do not see myself committing suicide at this point (although if assisted suicide becomes available I would take it). Although I think a real part of accepting my condition is realizing that I am not all that special and can now more clearly see and accept the fact that Aspergers/Autism just does not work. I will say that one benefit (there are not many) is I do think I am a bit less judgemental after realizing how Aspergers/Autism impacts me. I can now more clearly see that jobs like sex work are no less respectable than any other company and have more respect for those workers and realizing that there is no shame in what they are doing. I feel like part of the acceptance stage (final step in stage of grief) should be admittance to want of death",Suicidal

"I spent 2 hours writing a post on here until my phone glitched and deleted it all. Then I realized I was over sharing &amp; decided not to type it all out again. It was good therapy venting to myself anyways.7 months ago my newborn son passed away, 2 days before his 1 month birthday. He stopped breathing in his sleep, spent 9 hours at ER &amp; then passed away in my husband &amp; Is arms. I thought I was doing better but these past few weeks have been miserable. I was told prior to conceiving him (and after 4 miscarriages) that I had pcos and probably would never be able to conceive or have a pregnancy success. I found out two days before Mothers Day 2020 that I was having him &amp; I named him after Gabriel the messenger of God. He was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. I wish every day I was the one who died instead of him.I am only 20 years old, yet I feel as if I have been through so much. I feel like God is punishing me in my life and I can never be happy. I do not understand why he had to cut short the life of a beautiful baby. I cannot eat, I am always tired, I am always reliving the moment my husband runs into our room screaming hes not breathing.Every night I fall asleep to images of what I think he would look like now. I am trying to conceive again to no avail. I want to be a mother so badly but no other baby will be like him, and my body will not cooperate regardless. I do not want to kill myself but I feel like I have nothing to live for anyways.He saved my from a severe eating disorder &amp; addiction. He made me grow up and turned me into a woman. I moved out, I got my shit together, my husband and I got married so my baby could have a happy home.I will never get to see him take his first steps, say momma for the first time, get to give him his first taste of sugar.

I am afraid of taking on the responsibility of livingI have a few things i want to see happen, but i do not have any other reason to stay in ~1 year, and many reasons not to stay. Yes i am a coward, and i will die as one, one day. I am a coward",Suicidal

"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for 10 years. For the most part I managed it, and I had a decent life and support system. But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse. I have never felt more alone and scared in my life, I think about suicide every minute, and I have come up with a plan. I am 23 with no college degree, barely any work history, with no hope for an actual future. I have lost the one person I could got to about anything, because I cannot burden my mom with everything she is going through. I see a therapist every week and it has been zero help. She recommended a residential therapy program for a month, which I feel like is worth a try but the problem is I cannot leave my mom. She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her. I feel so trapped, so hopeless, so terrified. I know that makes me a selfish person, I know I need to suck it up and help my mom. But fuck I do not know how I can keep going like this. I do not see any other way out",Suicidal

"I am so depressed.The thing is, growing up I had high dreams for myself.Really high dreams.I was lucky in the sense that I was born with talents. I could sing and grew up being praised for my voice. I was a fabulous writer who thrived off books and poetry. As I got into my teen years I began to love fashion. I could have been a singer, or a writer or even a fashion designer.I could have had friends. Fun, hilarious and artistic friends like me. And instead, I became none of those things I so desperately loved. I do not have any friends because I am pretty different and I do not find it easy to click with people that often, especially in the town I ended up living in.I am 31 and I have a daughter who I adore and love more than life itself. But I still cannot help but feel cheated out of the life I felt I knew I was meant to have.When I hear music, sometimes I cry just thinking about how I wanted to do that. If I see a woman thriving in her writing career,Well.. you guessed it!

"So as title states. I had ran out of medication. I tried to get it refilled , made a few calls to my psychiatrist office left a couple messages. Even spoke to someone days before it supply ran out. But in the end it was not refilled. Mind you I had not had an appointment since maybe January as I missed my last telephone appointment sometime in spring I believe. I was on the max dose of the prescription , I had been on this since the end of 2017 although my dose was not maxed out till around the start of 2019 if I recall correctly. I had been skipping doses here and there but never more than 2 days at a time sometimes I would forget if I had taken my dose for the day and most times I elected not to take said possible missed dose for that day in the event that I did take it. So I am wondering what to expect in the coming weeks or months. Mind you I have a lot of other mental impairments aside from severe depression and bipolar. Some I do not even know anything about. I am currently not sleeping too much , it is a lot more difficult to fall asleep now. I am having brain shocks and what not often. I feel like I used to prior to taking this medication. Extreme tiredness , slurring my words often , not feeling alive at all. (Even on the medication I felt tired and weak but it was not as bad as it is while off it)I wake up early now and after being up maybe .. 5 hours I start to feel so tired and have 0 energy but cannot nap/sleep While off the medication , if I go for a walk or exercise I get this high and feel like I can do anything (lol) while on medication I did not really get that even after doing those activities. This is a lot to read and I am sure I confused anyone who has made it this far. But I am hopeful to get some kind of response. (I have an appointment with a new mental health professional in 2 weeks) if that matters I ran out of Citalopram about 8 or so days ago. what is going to happen?",Depression

"I have been close to my friend for four years, in the friendship I was constantly apologizing for the mistakes that were not my own. We got in a lot of fights, mostly about respecting each other, since he never respected me. I made mistakes in the friendships, he made some overly bad mistakes. I was so scared of losing my friendship it ended up hurting me in the end. Throughout the friendship, I helped him so much, paid for so much, bought him things to make him happy, and helped him with a girl that he loved for so long, just so he could be happy. So many things, because a part of me thought he was going to be my best friend for life, and I was manipulated a lot throughout the friendship. Fast forward near our graduation, he gave me covid-19, and throughout covid 19, my dad passed away when I got symptoms, and I had to be locked in a small room throughout, and I never got to see my dad in his last moments/ when he passed. I stood in a room shaking, and that same idea torment's my soul, and has just weighed a huge amount of anxiety towards me. When I had covid, he would not let me tell any of our friends, he kept saying how it will ruin the friendship between me and him, and others. I was threatened, and vulnerable during the situation as my dad was currently in the hospital in critical condition. The only thing keeping me sane throughout the process that we were still friends, and he knew the most about my dad and I could talk to him. Throughout this incident, a month later he ended up cutting me off for reason's that I regret, but summary was he talked shit about me to make people hate me, and basically it was a situation between how these people hated eachother, and forced it upon me and him, and basically the two girls manipulated him the entire time to hate the two girls. At the end it switched up on me for the wrong reasons, lies were being told. In the end my friend basically got mad for bringing up his name and he told me to go kill myself, and told me I deserve everything that is happening to me. Now it continues that I am losing my other friends, I have fallen into depression, and he is slowly making everyone hate me. The only thing keeping me sane was being able to talk to people and distract myself, but nothing has gone good. Every single week something worse happens, and I just do not want to be on this planet anymore. I do not want to go throughout life, my life is over, my dad is gone, and everything is just garbage. It comes to the point where I cannot even explain this situation because it is so long, and it is so fucked up. I just wan't to be happy again, but i will truly never find happiness.

"When I was younger, in my childhood, I had self worth, I still had anxiety, but I felt like I was the best at everything. I was a ""gifted"" child and did well in school, in fact my only main source of anxiety was if my crush liked me back. Either way I felt special and unique. I have had worrying behavior before where I would cut myself with school scissors and even younger as a toddler, I would bang my head against the wall or floor. Still. Those things were rare of me though maybe I should I have taken it as a sign of things to come. In middle school I was anxious but I still felt nice and special. 9th grade was when things changed though, I started to get bullied which made me reevaluate myself, I started seeing myself in a negative light, and the only way I coped was sleep or being in a constant state of self loathing. There were times I made threats to the students that were bullying me, but instead of thinking it was wrong, I doubted my capabilities to go through with the threat. After 9th grade I felt better going to another high school, I was not getting bullied, and even though I was not quickly making friends, people still let me hang around them or sit at their table. It was nice. I met my ex boyfriend not too long after and we stayed together for 3 years. He ended up leaving me during my first semester of college. I felt sad about it, but having been in a relationship for 3 years gave me a false sense of security that finding another relationship might be easy. I was quite wrong. Not only that but I started to realize many people were better than me and were skilled at something while I realized I was not. I was quite literally not good at anything or at least not good enough. However, this world requires you to contribute something to it. I could not. The former gifted child felt lied to. That I could do anything and I had great potential. It bothered me a lot. I did not feel like I could conquer anything like I used to. Instead, I was smacked in the face with the truth that I was not special and my best was not good enough. Through this period people kept telling me to keep trying and I eventually will get good. I did not see any improvement, in some areas I felt like I was getting worse. Right now I am stuck with the feeling of inferiority and suicidal thoughts. I am not quite doing anything for this world, in a way I feel like I am taking up space that could be used for a much more skilled and intelligent individual. Recently I looked through documents of tests that were done when I was younger in elementary school. I found that I lacked critical thinking skills and had a language disorder as well as anxiety. I thought my IQ may have been better but I tested below average for verbal iq and only slightly above average for non verbal with the highest in calculating. Right now I am not sure how to move forward... but I am too scared to kill myself. I have never been good enough. .",Suicidal

He gives terrible advice that just makes me angry do not feel you cannot take a vacation. That does not solve the problem of the actual job!

I had to cancel the day before my trip, actually day of, as I was on the phone for that long trying to cancel and recoup everything.

I can understand why they want to do that , people here , all neighbours , judge a lot, and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted, and I have to pretend , which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you , I do not want to talk to you, but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep, I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made , how stupidly wrong they were , it is not like I am correct, but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words , it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain, is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight.

"Fuck I wish I was not so much of a damn coward about it, so many times I wish I could get it over with.Just do not really want to put my mom through that, also do not want to risk my school loans being dumped on her--do not entirely trust that my own death would be the end of it.I always chastise myself about feeling like this, that my stupid issues are not anything compared to the suffering many go through.Yet that logic goes out the window when stress causes my anxiety to feel like it is ripping and clawing at my throat. That for everything I try to do to actually be useful to others almost always seems to backfire one way or another, like a constant reminder that I am always going to be worthless, that it is the punishment I deserve for even being born.That it is my own fault for even trying in the first place. Or my own fault for not being able to ignore the pain in my back and knees more so I could push myself to just fucking do better. I mean why should I care if I ruin my body now? I barely expected myself to make it this far, to live this long. I mean eventually even cowardice will reach its own breaking point I imagine. Constant reminders of failure and uselessness ramming against the dam will because it to shatter at some point. A meaningless existence like mine is surely destined to fizzle out soon enough. I just wish my death would not be as much of a burden as my life has been.How nice it would be to just pop away, to erase my debts and traces of my life as if I was never here to begin with. I know so many people fear the very idea of the end. But at this point I am either numb to the aspect of it or almost in a way dream of that time finally coming. I mean I could remember a time dreaming of what it might be like to finally be better, to find the joy and wonders of life--which I mean I can appreciate and all, but there is also this sort of tarnish that constantly smudges everything when you have to live like this. That nothing can ever be good for too long. That things that bring you down have to roll over again and again until you just stop fighting and just become the punching bag that everything seems to zero in on. And maybe that is what the idea of death inviting in it is own way. That once you enter that dark abyss there just is not anything anymore. No terrible things to constantly remind you of how worthless you are, no good things that always perks up that joy and hope no matter how in vain you know it is, just waiting for them to be ripped away again like they always are.Just a peaceful empty where I can fade away into nothing, where I can stop being a burden to everyone around me. But until then I guess I will just have to stick to dreaming. A mistake of a life",Suicidal
"There is someone very close to me with depression and i have no idea how to respond when they vent to me, I have never been good with handling other peoples feelings and I do not want them to think I am dismissing their feelings, I really do care about them and I feel bad when they trust me enough to vent and I am just speechless. Any help is appreciated! How do I comfort someone when they vent to me?",Depression

"I do not like where I am at in this point of my life. I do not even like looking at myself anymore. I feel uncomfortable with looking at myself. I am so stressed from everything going on at home. I do not want to be here to live through it. Its kind of a pussy move, but I am over it. I had confidence - and now its being taken away from me again. I do not have the energy to cry either . I just want to go to sleep.I know I make these posts like all the time but its like I cannot do anything for myself anymore. I do not want to look at myself. I hate myself.

"So I have literally not done an entire course's worth of work and I am most likely going to fail this semester if I cannot turn in the homework by the end of this week, but I have not worked on it even a littleI do not understand why I cannot get anything done and yet I continue to do it, I always am just in time for appointments, just in time to get to work, and barely late for assignments. I cannot seem to get a foothold no matter how hard I try to, because no matter what I am barely scraping by. I have no free time because the rest of it is filled with worry.I work part time and do school full time, and it makes me want to die, not only literally but figuratively as well. I can literally feel the pain in my soul when I put off the assignment, the quiz, the test, and eventually, the class. It hurts so goddamn much you would not believe, but then I go ahead and just do it to myself again.I see it as something almost akin to climate change, as depressing as that sounds. Like the worst part about this inescapable loop, is that it is inherently completely avoidable if I simply did the work. But I cannot bring myself to do it so I do not know what to do, and every second of inaction is another assignment missing, so I am watching my possibilities burn with fear as I stand like a deer in the headlights. &amp;#x200B;I am powerless to my inability to work and I cannot strive nor see myself striving to do anything other than work.

"my brother has not spoken to our mother in over 10 years and he just started speaking(texting) to me again after ghosting me for 3 years. I was listening to music and a song came on that always made me think of our family situation. I did not think he would even listen or reply but he did and he sent me back a song that must have been on his heart with the situation and knowing that is how he feels breaks my heart. Growing up we were abused. When he would be the one on the receiving end of the abuse it always broke me to see my big, strong, charismatic, athletic brother have such a deep sadness but the kind you can only recognize if you have felt the same way. No tears or screaming..just brokenness. I have recovered from my childhood very well considering. However that small interaction with my brother the other day has really brought back a lot of feelings. I adore my brother while on the other hand I have made the decision to forgive our mother and that is something that will always put a strain on our relationship. We went from being so so close to now me having a 2.5y/o he is never even met even though I have invited him many times. He also agreed to come meet her on her birthday and canceled 20min before he was supposed to be here. He told me that the only way he feels like he can be okay is to be independent and prove to himself he does not need anyone. Me on the other hand feels like in order for me to be okay i need to hug my brother and tell him i love him and see him be an uncle to my baby :( so basically I have been crying since monday and thinking about how i do have unresolved anger towards our mom and maybe i need to talk to her about how i feel, but I have felt fine with everything for awhile until finding out how hurt my brother still is a vent post, triggering convo w/ brother",Depression
"All I have to do is browse the reddit comments. ""You look like mom's neck beard basement dweller"", ""I would date your second chin"". And I think that some of these ""roasts"" could apply to me. I am a woman. I have been told I am attractive. I think I am. I only weigh 110 lbs and I am 5'6"". But I still have excess weight I gained after losing a pregnancy and being put on birth control. So the double chin comment really gets to me. Everytime I see a negative comment, I think about how my closest friends could say or think the same thing about me. Especially since one of my closer guy friends is a guy I crushed on, recently told and got rejected by in the nicest way possible. I have trust issues. I sometimes think I am not as great as I think I am in the moment. That my friends are internally roasting me in their heads while I look like an egotistical, arrogant, a-hole. Thank you for coming to my ted talk. Today's been rough. I have been struggling with suicidal ideation ever since I flirted with my guy friend again and made things akward. It seemed like he was flirting at first but I think I misperceived the intent in his speech and screwed up again. there is more to this story but I do not want to get into it. I cannot tell if I am overthinking, paranoid and waiting for betrayal or if my intuition is on to some things. So I deacti everything. I am staying away.

"I feel like I have always had one sided friendships. like I am always the one who puts in all the work. And it sucks because it used to hurt less. When I was a kid, before I moved for the first time, friendships were easy. My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time. we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends. and then I moved. and I was the weird new kid. it took me three years to make friends. and just when I started to fit in, we moved again. and again, I was the weird new kid. I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established. but because they would known each other forever, they never included me in anything. because I was not really one of them. I bounced around friend groups for 3 years. until I met the new weird girl. we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends. we are still best friends more than 10 years later. we made our own friend group and it was nice. but she graduated 2 years before I did. and the year after she left, my friend group changed. we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader. they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me. except one. and I was... okay. I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups. but then they all graduated. or moved. and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed. I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have. so I dropped out. cut off all my hair. attended the local community college to get my GED. kept my head down mostly. did not really make friends. after I got my GED I kept taking classes. nothing in particular, just general stuff. edged my way into more friend groups. again, they never made plans with me. but I was used to it. I did my own thing. and I was ok. I had a job then. and a semi decent boyfriend. I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year. dropped out. lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school. worked and spent time with my boyfriend. life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time, a good job, and a semi decent boyfriend. and then we broke up. and my parents moved. so I moved. in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to. and he went to work in Alaska. left me alone in a house with four animals to look after, a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos. i made one friend that was a good friend. kept me company when I needed it. washed my dishes if I made him food. took me out places. he was probably the only reason I am still alive. then the man who is house I lived in came back. I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in. the friend who would saved me stopped texting. stopped responding. after six months of no friends and no job, I moved back to my ""hometown"" to be with my boyfriend. who kicked me out in less than a month. so I lived with my sister. and her two kids, husband and fil. slept on a cot in my niece's room. eventually broke up with my boyfriend. worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends. in a desperate move, I moved in with a new partner. to a different state. this one I would at least visited. I got a job. we had nice roommates. everything was nice. until my partner had a mental breakdown. moved out. left me alone where I could not afford the rent. so I moved across the country, back to my parents. where I live still. I have been here for two years. no job. a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend. that never reaches out if I do not reach out first. never wants to spend time with me unless I ask. and suddenly I am back in middle school. a depressed fuck with no real friends, no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place. shitty friends are the worst. I do not even try anymore. I do not want to try anymore. I want to fade into the background until no one remembers I ever existed. If you are reading this, know that I do not want to die. I do not want to stop living. my death would be too painful to people I care about. I would never do that to them. but if a genie came to me and gave me one wish, I would ask to have never been born. obviously, there is a lot more going on that fuels my depression but this is the most prevalent right now. Rant. Down in my feels tonight. it is a long one.",Depression
"Before I really wanted to be happy, i know it is not just something you can get but i was tired of being depressed all the time. At this point, I do not even want to be happy anymore. It seems like too much of a mess and too much effort for something that will not even last. I feel like i have already tried so many times to be happy, and none of them worked. Even when I have people that love me, friends, hobbies, life still seemed so shit. Is this just it? At some point i just stopped attempting and accepted that I will never be happy with my life. The only way i see an end to this is suicide, but I am just too scared to do that either. I also know that i will hurt some people if i do die, and in the end, i just feel like I am trapped here with nowhere to go. It makes it all the more frustrating that i hate being here but i cannot just kill myself . I feel like i do not even want to be happy anymore.

"This evening, like 2 hours ago, I planned my suicide. I planned where I was going to do it, and a few days ago I planned the day that i was going to do it (this friday). But almost 30 minutes ago after I washed my face and cleaned my hair, i feel amazing about myself. This happens EVERY DAY. I get really suicidal because I loose my plans for the future, and because I am very self conscious about my looks, to the point where I have tried to cut my nose to make it look better (but failed). This lasts for about 90 percent of the day, but then at around 10 percent of the day (usually occurring at night) I feel like I am beautifal and that I feel amazing about myself (but I still do not see my future for myself as I lost most of my hopes and hobbies but that does not make me feel any less worst during those times of the day). I have been diagnosed with depression before, but I lied to my therapist because I did not want to get in trouble with my parents and told her I was ok, so in her and my parents eyes it looks to me that I am getting a ton better, (they think I am doing better because I get hella good grades and the best grades out of all my siblings despite having depression) but I am not.

"I have never really felt like I belonged or that anyone really cared about me. My family is very bad at showing affection, praise or even attention. As a child, my parents were too busy working and raising my younger siblings to give me the attention I needed. Fast forward and all my high school friends abandoned me for their significant others. I was the only one who was not in a relationship. there is a reason I do not talk to them anymore. When I turned 21, I met my future wife. We dated for 5 years before I proposed. We married and after 3 years, she wanted out. She lost her attraction to me was her reasoning. She left me in our home and she took our child with her. The only living creature that ever gave me unconditional love was my dog. She was really my only friend the year after my child was born. My wife withheld affection and intimacy from me when I asked for it. I had to put my dog to sleep because she had an inoperable tumor on her heart. After that, I had no one and its where I am today. I am fearful that when I start dating again, I am going be afraid of rejection or possible abandonment. Trust is very hard to come by for me and I am socially anxious to begin with.

"I am 25 years old and I have never had a girlfriend, had sex, ben on a date, kissed, held hands, been touched by, been asked out, etc. I graduated college last May. At my on campus job I became friends with a girl who I eventually fell head over heels in love with.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. She texted me last year to say hi, I answered and she never answered me back. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years.The pain from never being able to be with her has made me suicidal and I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.Something this is rooted in is my crush wrote poetry a lot and I bought a copy of a collection she published while we were still friends in 2019. In the collection tehre was a poem about her losing her virginity. Reading that absolutely destroyed me. It kept me awake for days. I could not stand the thought of someone else having sex with someone I loved so dearly and longed to care for so much. One day, she confided in me that her recent ex had been physically abusing her. More pain. Id fantasize about having sex with her but it would not help. I just imagined what it would be like if she actually loved me back and was attracted to me.Its getting to the point where everything related to having sex and relationships in general is painful to me. I even am starting to experience sexual dysfunction: I do not get aroused as easily amd I can no longer watch pornography because it upsets me to see people being intimate because it makes me jealous and depressed that the is something I have never experienced before. I hear people talk about their gfs and wives and I get extremely sad.I found out my 20 year old sister lost her virginity months ago and when I did I cried for days. I felt indescribably disgusting and pathetic. I am 25. I should have lost my virginity first. I should have a gf or wife by now. Everything related to sex and relationships makes me violently depressed. It ruins my day.I am so fucking sick of feeling like this.

"Burner account for obvious reasons.It is so hard to have to seem like I am alright 24/7. Nobody asks me how I am doing. Nobody reaches out to me first. I could go days without meaningful conversation. My childhood was beyond fucked up. My father killed himself and my mother became addicted to drugs. My siblings and I were neglected. I was molested by another kid in the foster home that I stayed at for 2 months, and told nobody because I was ashamed that it happened to me as a male. My siblings and I stayed with our single grandmother for 2 grueling years until she could not take care of 4 children anymore. She sent my two sisters back into foster care, and for that I cannot blame her. I never got to say goodbye so I feel like they died, and there were suddenly less people who truly understood what I have gone through.I finished my last year of middle school and all of high school constantly hiding my depression. Some days are fine and other days are miserable. However, I never let it show how hopeless I was. When my grandmother and I would fight over the smallest things she took me to therapy for a few weeks of my junior year. She thought I had anger issues, but I truly do not so I got diagnosed with an undeclared mood disorder. I just did not want to open up too random stranger about anything. My uncle asked me once in my freshman or sophomore year of high school if I was depressed and I lied and said no. I have not opened up to anyone because, as a male, people are uncomfortable when we show vulnerability. I hate crying in front of others.COVID robbed me of the rest of my senior year of high school. I lost connection with the friends I was making and some of the friends I had. I have never felt more alone in life now than ever. I cannot remember the last time I left the house to spend time with friends. If I stop reaching out nobody will bother to check and see how I am doing. I live a meaningless life and I am expected to suck it up and work a full time job that I dislike very much. I am uncertain of what career path will help me most in my future. My grandmother ensures me that my time at her home is very limited and that it is not a safety net. I am very sure that I will end up killing myself in the near future. My brother already has bipolar depression, so I am worried that if I end my life he will suffer. I know that everyone else that has been in my life will forget about me soon after. They probably hate how closed off I am, but the primary reason I close myself off is to spare them from the pessimism that I keep inside me day to day. I am not going to burden other people with my suffering. So since I am I coward who cannot kill himself, enjoy the vague, depressing (haha) essay that I typed. I just wanted to get this out here so I feel less alone. do not reach out to me to tell me it gets better. Its a shallow phrase used by people lucky enough to have had people who care enter their life. Good for you. I might never come to check if my post was recognized because I really do not care. I just wanted to vent.Sorry for being self centered here. Sorry if some things made no sense.Sorry for wasting your time.I will not end my life anytime soon, but later most likely. I am 19 and already very tired. Thanks for reading I am going to off myself as soon as I get the courage.",Depression

"I am 17, been on Effexor for about a year. I was suicidal before starting it and now I feel mostly fine.

Also, I am sexually active with my girlfriend and I cannot cum - we have had sex probably like twice a week, for the last 2 months, and I have finished exactly 1 time. Its horrible.

I started using sun beds and tanning without suncream because I thought it I go bald I need look dark as white people look sick when bald.My idea was to burn my skin so it is permanently dark.Fast forward a few years not only is my once luxiourios long thick hair half disappeared my face looks like a burns victim. I stopped the sun bathing due to this this my skin is white anyway the irony but all saggy and scarred qnd aged. Fant even hide it with my long hair as I have no long hair so my face is fully visible now. So Combine this with my thin receding hair I have gone from looking like a boy band teen to I am going to some hideous creature.When we people take pics when I have to go out work or family etc restarts they always upload pics without me. The ones with me do not go on Facebook etc...it is obvious they do not want my fuked up face on social media and I do not blame them.Now the issue as a result before covid I avoid everything. No spontaneous life anymore. Going out for 2 or 3 days in a row. Random parties or nights out. I just became a recluse.I need to always carry or wear a hat i couosnt dare sleep over some place now. I live in constant fear over my looks.I hoped lockdown would make me feel less missing out as everyone same boat and time to avoid sun use creams fix my skin improve diet hope hair improve.But over 18 months my hair is worse and face not look any better.Well nobody is going out anyway with covid round here but I still feel my life is fuked because I had it all.I looked normal and had social fun life now I am just constant obsessing and looking mirror qns almost crying.I cannot even look mirror anymore to soul destroying only in dim lights.I cannot believe only some years ago my skin was perfect and hair amazing long.Of course hair loss can happen but I see people grandparents with still nice skin so that is all my stupid fault qnd cannot improve it.Depresses me every day.I eat well workout in good shape I gueas etc but all seems pointless Is it stupid to be suicidal due to appearance",Suicidal
"I have been trying to understand what that compulsion is I felt when I wanted to die. I know this is a tricky question because it would be so deeply personal and individual to everyone, but I am curious if anyone can lucidly explain everything going on during this moment.For me all I remember was there was many terrible things happening to me and I was trying to just go about my regular day and as I was travelling in my wheelchair I stopped. My head was telling me that I needed to drive onto the highway and go in front of the trucks that we are approaching.I just froze and sat in that feeling and those thoughts crying trying to understand what it all was. I had idolised about death and thought about it a lot but that was the first moment where my instincts were telling me to go and do it there and then.Is this similar to everyone else? Just a spiralling of terrible thoughts and Realisations leading to the strong desire to die? Or are there other nuances to it? What is in that moment?",Suicidal
"All my life my family has been toxic and I have always suffered from depression and severe anxiety.. I started cutting around the time I entered middle schoolI turned 19 a month ago but for the past 3 years everything has gotten worse. My older sister emotionally and verbally abuses me and my family. She used to say once I turned 18 she would fight me, I thought about killing myself just to avoid everything. But I did not and now I am 19. I do not want to really get into details but believe me when I say the past 3 years have been hell I am exhaustedmy sister would threaten our lives and her own. Using everything she could against us. We kicked her out many times but she let us herself back in. The police have been to my house thousands of times. I know she struggles with mental issues and she is in pain too but now I am exhausted and my depression and anxiety have worsened. I have recently turned to drugs I am abusing them so badly everyday I get high if I can drink Ill get wasted I have also recently started having sneaky links to feel something. The first time I cried while doing stuff because I know its wrong but I also just do not care.I am self destructing and the worst thing is I am witnessing myself do it and I cannot stop it. I have become so numb to the world around meand when I am actually happy I feel guilty because I know my mom and the kids are sad with the situation.I have wanted to move out but if I do I am leaving them behind to deal with my sisterwell I guess either way Id be leaving them.I do not want to die but I am tired of waking up to this numb feeling. I have medication but I think need something stronger now. Lately I have been having cutting urges. I am just so lost i do not know what to do anymore somebody pleasehelp me my intrusive thoughts have never been this bad I do not know if I can do this anymore and I am scared I am going to end it.

"I feel like I am falling off the deep end. I do not think I cannot take anymore of this. Nothing I do is useful! I have tried therapy, medication, and try to go on normally. I end up in the same old place every time.I feel terrible about myself. I just want to drop out of college and give up on my dreams. I am not as great as the others, so what is the point in proceeding. Sure, I make good grades, but I do not have any great skill or talents. Everyone around me is so much better than I am, and there is me. Unlike everyone else who is worth something, I am about as valuable as a speck of dust just there to be thrown away. I might as well give up on my dreams. It probably was not important anyways.I just want to give up. I want to give up on everything. I do not Know How Much More I Can Take It.",Suicidal
"So I posted to a group where me and my friends chat about how if I was gone for a long period without talking (2 weeks since I am quite active there) that I was probably dead. The reason being my parents want us to move to the country side with no internet beacause they are conspiracy theorists and such and the internet is basically my only support. And I honestly could not talk to them about my problems and they no way would not move to the country side even if I pleaded on my knees and I honestly do not think I would want to live anymore at that pointI have anger issues and when I get quite angry I have the urge to take a knife and stab myself in the throat and I am quite open about this to my family of course they take it as a joke a little goof a gag a punchline. So they never take it seriously to be honest if we did move I would probably stab myself to death or at least drown myself I could not stand moving so far away from my dreams ambitions and friends like that and at that point I do not see a reason to live my life is already screwed up so I do not see a reason to stay at that point So back to my friends I told them straight up if I am gone for 2 weeks no talking, that I probably killed myself. I wanted them to know this since I did not like the idea of them never knowing what happened to me since I know if i was in they are position that I would want to know why someone so active just stopped posting and I left for bed I came back tomorrow and only one of them said anything out of the 4 friends 1 of them ignored me (maybe did not see the message but be were never all that close) and the other 2 had not posted so I assume they were offline The one that responded did not know how to react and when I checked recently they were panicking asking if anyone saw me online and that they were worried about me and I do not know how to respond staying silent would be a dick move I do not want to make them upset Y'know but at the same time I do not know what to say I cannot promise that I will not kill myself it is the truth I would buy do not like seeing the upset but I do not want them to live on thinking I am okay I am honestly confused I am only 13 and I honestly cannot think of what to say to them.

Then around the end of may I got super depressed again and even worse than before, I even started self harming for a few weeks. I have somewhat normalized again but I am not recovering.

"How i lost my dad3 years ago, when I was 13 years old, my dad got in to a really bad accident. My dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. Unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck, skull, spine and almost everything you can think of. When i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things I have ever seen. Seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. I had never felt so powerless. In the following months after the accident, we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. The man who always was the guy I could on. The man who was always supporting me on the sideline, but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. He had to accept he had lost it all. His work (he could not and still cannot), his sports (cycling, running, swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man ( one of the toughest sport races in the world)). With my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. While at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease, the only thing I can hope for now is that my family stays together. Because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state, he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. While we all love him as much as we did before the accident, the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. The pain I am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. But losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. He cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things, while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation. Right now I feel like I have lost the man who was on my side for the biggest part of my life. How I lost my dad",Depression

They would not have anyone to take care of them. that is what they would miss. And maybe they should. I have told them countless times how I feel. They do not care. Maybe they deserve to be heartbroken. I do not deserve to suffer so why should I stay? Fuck this. See you next time. I am not enough to observe",Suicidal

"Before I start, I promise I will show this and my other suicide notes to my therapist whenever I see them. I have been suffering from mental health illnesses for years (was diagnosed 6 years ago). I hate it. I genuinely hate it. I have to take meds to boost serotonin levels (store-bought serotonin as I call them). On my birthday in June, I told myself I will end things an year from then (provided things do not get better). I am 24 and am yet to do achieve anything significant (unlike my parents, siblings, close friends and connections on LinkedIn). Turning 24 recently is really hitting me hard. I graduated university at 21 and have done internships (a local bank, a Big 4 firm consulting firm and startups) every now and then. My last paid internship ended before the summer of 2020. I am yet to secure a full-time paid job since, unlike my peers who are pretty successful in the corporate world (i.e. they are getting promoted or moving to international offices say London, UK). But, then, there is me. I have wasted the last 3 years of my life. I could have learnt a new language. I could have learnt new software (say PowerBI). I could have been studying towards a professional qualification (say CFA, CAPM etc.). I could have lost weight and gained muscle. My ex left me at 21 because of me being suicidal and unstable back then. But, my untreated mental illnesses do not let me too. I messed up the final two years at university (relative to my first year performance which was stellar). At all of my internships, I was extremely slow with tasks i.e. making PPT slides, replying to emails (I believe I have undiagnosed psychomotor retardation). In my daily life, I avoid doing a lot of chores, for instance, doing the dishes, folding my laundry, cooking, reading a book. It takes me 30ish minutes to do the dishes (something that would take my sibling 15 minutes). It takes me 7 minutes to read a page of a novel. Taking that into account, it would take me 2 months to finish a 300 page novel. Because of how slow I am, I have gotten very dumb too (I struggle with basic mental maths and avoid doing things that require a lot of brain power). I am not even sure if therapy would help me. I am scared of entering the corporate world or pursuing a masters. Because of how slow and dumb I am and how stressed I get in pressured situations. I point fingers towards my untreated mental illnesses. At times, I wish I had cancer or something similar to show people around me that I was actually struggling. Even though, I told myself I will commit suicide a day after my birthday next year in June. If things do not get better (i.e. I do not land a full-time job and not be as slow as I am today). However, I feel like ending things this Saturday. My method of suicide would be jumping off a bridge (near a major public hospital) and getting hit by an incoming vehicle once I jump. Or, I will overdose on my meds. But, very likely, that will be next June. Whenever I hear of people dying on the news or from other sources, I say ""Lucky them. I wish it was me instead of them."" I always pray I die in my sleep. But, here, I fucking am. I know things will not get better (there is too many things to work on and fix). I am better off dying, either naturally or via suicide. I am currently working on launching a non-profit startup, centered around mental health. In that case, it will further motivate everyone involved in case I end up killing myself. Turning 24 has really hit me. It feels like I have run out of time to achieve things......it is too hard to turn things around. If you have made it this far, I appreciate you reading of my struggles and my suicidal thoughts. I have had enough (In tears as I type this)",Suicidal

"I had group therapy for the first time today. It sucked, I quit immediately. There are not any in person one on one therapists here. Not only that, I do not even really know what to do to get better. Or if I want to get better in the first place. My biggest problem, that I am Non-binary, is not even fixable. Outcast amongst outcasts, it is got to be the most hated minority since even other trans people hate on us. Not to mention other LGBT people and obviously everyone else. I read that like 87% of people would not even date a trans person, so I am assuming the numbers even higher for nonbinary people. Which makes everything very isolating. There is no way in the world I could even date in my current state, but even if I could I would never find anyone nearby. I thought the first step would be going to therapy, but that is over. I looked up the ones that take my insurance and there is like 4 in this area, 0 of which offer in person. And then even if we pretend everything else was solved, I still have no way to support myself. No way I can work because everything makes me want to kill myself, no way to go back to school because I am poor. No interests or passions at all besides making art.

"Currently 22. Life keeps getting progressively getting worse. Had pretty much everything going for me coming out of HS, lots of friends, a girlfriend who loved me, good family life, confidence etc. Things pretty much started to go down hill when I started college out of state. Gf broke up due to distance, she went to a different school. This pretty much sent me into a depression, have not gotten out of it. Did some of the right things, joined a fraternity, went out a good amount. Just never really developed a close group of friends at my new school, just kind acquaintances who came and went. Long story short developed a drug and alcohol problem and slowly but surely have become a loner. Most people I either got sick of my bs or just have moved on to their new lives now and most of my class has graduated. Have about 2-3 people I would consider friends, both at home and in school. Now I am a 22 year old sophomore.Troubles with the law and an accidental overdose in the past 2 years have just made things worse both mentally and in my day to day life. On probation, so going out to bars and socializing is pretty much out of the picture (I go to a party/sports school in a s town so that pretty much makes up 95% of the social life ) Been sober for 8 months and honestly just feel worse from when I had a drug problem. At least then I had confidence and the motivation to go out and at least make the effort to improve my life. Now I just sit in my apartment/room all day. do not have motivation to try and make new friends because of how many times I have failed at it and a lack of self esteem.

Not necessarily through suicide but by any means, like, freak accidents, accidental overdose, just anything that will end my life. Nothing ever happens, but sometimes it makes me wonder what would happen if I did die. How would it affect my loved ones?Has anyone ever lost someone close on that person's birthday, and how did the passing of this person affect you and the other people close to him/her? I am mainly looking for people who died by their own choice, but if it was due to other causes you can still comment.

"I just had surgery for a potentially serious type of cancer. I have been in a good mood, except for the first week when I was told the diagnosis. I made the mistake of consulting Dr. Google and it sent me into anxiety.I had serious bouts of depression 30 years ago and a few bouts since then. Six hospitalizations, lots of med changes, stress, career disasters, relationship disasters, and substance abuse (alcohol).I have been sober for many decades, got to retire at 50, have no financial worries. Never got married and that one really bothers me some times. I was successful, high average attractive, sales for big corporations so had money. As a friend of mine likes to say, ""Women are not looking for guys like us"", (guys with morbid depression). God, I had a couple women in my mid twenties that were so gorgeous and smart as hell, but my behavior drove them off or I ditched them for a bottle.Anyways, I am in post recovery, have some post surgical aches and still waiting to hear pathology. I got sort of sad and moody this week. I think I will be in good shape, I was Stage II with something you do not want to go Stage III. Actually I could be III because the pathology is not back yet. I stopped doing things I like to do, painting, going out into the forests, fly fishing. I bought a new carbon fiber canoe a month ago, you can pick up with your pinky. I have not set that boat in a lake or river yet this summer. I sometimes think my life was a bust, I die without kids or a partner, what was the point?Just venting, sure things will get better.

My current job is a work study job that requires me to be a student. My last day is Friday . My sister is about to move to college. I am so beyond proud but it scares me because I will not see her every day. I know they say call or FaceTime but it is not the same. My brother is actively trying to move out. I am the oldest sibling yet I still live at home. I cannot drive. I have so little work experience that no one wants to hire me. I feel pathetic, alone, lost, scared, depressed, worthless.

"I am a 17 yo guy and I have been struggling with depression, derealization and paranoia ever since I was 12. On top of that I now have GAD.I have been wanting to kill myself since I was 12 because at 12 yo I started having episodes of derealization caused by the paranoia that everything is a dream or fake.I have somewhat gotten over that, but all that has been replaced by depression and anxiety which caused me to fail 2 years of school. I hate myself for letting that happen.When school is on, every day I think of suicide and have really bad suicidal depressive mental breakdowns every night.Right now it is summer break, but I cannot take all that pressure again. Sadly, dropping out is not an option for me.I also hate myself because of my height. I am only 5'8/172cm tall and I live in a country where the male average height is 5'11/182cm. That makes me feel really inferior, weak and pathetic because most guys I know are taller than me.I think I feel bad about my height because I am secretly competitive so I have been feeling my whole life like growing taller is a competition.Just for the record, I am already in therapy and on antipsychotics and antidepressants.

"I have squandered most of my opportunities in life and i feel like a loser because I am. I was a high school athlete and I was a very social person growing up. Now, just turning 30 I have dropped out of college/university twice and only have a diploma in music production which makes me extremely overwhelmed and anxious anytime I even attempt to make anything. I was in Human resources last year and missed one course on my final semester so i never graduated. I hated the curriculum anyways... bunch of cucklord social justice bs...

Medication also does not seem to work for me. I get bad anxiety on antidepressants and yea... I also used to experiment with a lot of mdma and smoke a ton of pot over 5 -10 years ago when i was first in University and I think that might have fucked me up as well. Life just sucks man...

"I have never attempted suicide but over the last few months my life has become so overwhelming that its now a constant thought. My grandfather committed suicide when my mom was 10 years old which affected me in two ways. 1) I actually understand how painful it is for the people you leave behind, that is why I said I have never attempted it even though I have thought about it many many times, and 2) everyone in my family believes its hereditary and gets overly concerned when I am in a mood. It makes it impossible to talk to anyone close to me about my own thoughts of suicide because I feel like they will take it almost too seriously. I know that does not make sense but I actually hate when people feel sorry for me. So I bottle up my depression and lash out at the people I love. In a perverse way I almost wish they all hated me so that it would make it easier to leave them. The logical part of my brain says my life will turn around and the depression will subside - that is just how life is. Its just incredibly painful right now. Before anyone suggests I go see a therapist or get on medication, I have seriously thought about it but unfortunately my depression is currently stemming from the fact that my business failed, I am in a black hole of debt and I cannot afford health insurance. Money troubles - it does not get more cliche than that. I do not care if anyone reads this or responds I just found it incredibly therapeutic to finally vent all of this. This subreddit helped just to see that my situation is not unique and were all humans dealing with our own circumstances. there is probably someone in our life that is going through their own version of hell and well never know about it and there is definitely at least one person in our lives that deeply cares about us whether we recognize it or not.

"I am currently in a living situation that is far from ideal and becoming unbearable. I need to move out, but I feel immense guilt and concern because of how much I am needed here. Ill start by explaining my relationship with my family. Older brother (X): My mom and I immigrated from Cuba when I was 4 years old. I am now 21. We had to leave X behind (we are 11 years apart), and he did not come to the US until I was 16. Because of the cost of communication and our extreme poverty throughout those years, X and I did not get to know each other at all. When he came, he felt like a stranger that I was expected to love because of our blood relation. From the ages of 16-21, he has engaged with my body in sexual manners without my consent (grabbing my ass, slapping my ass, getting on top of me, removing my clothing, forcefully entering the bathroom when I am showering, and looking at me naked, etc.). No one is aware of this except my therapist. I should mention that he is an alcoholic, and some of these instances occurred when he was under the influence. About 2 years ago he moved out with his girlfriend, but they recently broke up so he moved back home. I am now living with him again. Younger brother (Y): Y and I are also strangely enough 11 years apart but on the other end. He is such an impeccable human. He is my best friend. Watching him grow up has been the most fulfilling experience of my life. Unfortunately, the responsibility is too much. His dad passed away when he was young so it was only him, my mom, and I until 2016 when X moved to the US and joined us. My mom had to work a lot, and I was relied on to take care of my Y. This had an extreme effect on my education, extracurricular, social life, and mental health. I did not sign up to become a parent. Apart from financial support, Y relies on me for everything. My mom relies on me for everything. Mom: This is, of course, the most complex relationship I have. However, I will not go into as much detail. She treats me like a child, does not allow me to see friends, constantly making homophobic remarks (does not know I am gay), constantly offending my expression or lack thereof, does not support any of my decisions, forces me to shave armpits and legs because it is gross and is unladylike, cannot talk to her because everything turns into an argument.... the list truly never ends. - But she needs me to take care of Y, translate every document, upkeep the house, etc. I understand her pain and suffering. She has been through so much. And I know she truly does need me. This is why I am still here. I am needed. I am afraid of what will happen to them without me. But I am tired! Of being used, disrespected, neglected, uncomfortable, abused... I am so exhausted. I need to focus on my life. I need to prioritize myself- but I cannot. I am stuck. We are all currently living in a small 2 bedroom house. My mom is sleeping in the living room while Y and I share a room and X has his own. I am in college but because of the pandemic, I am staying here. I probably will be taking the upcoming semester off because its too difficult to do school here. A few weeks ago I was suicidal, and I almost did it, but I realized that the reason I wanted to kill myself was also the reason that I could not.

"As the title says, I have been going bald for the past few years and it is made my life a living hell without a shred of hope. it is started when I was around 16.5-17 (24 now) and basically my life had stopped ever since. I need to mention I am using the common medications for hair loss, and though I have had nice results for some time, my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worse.I am so lonley, have no social life since I am ashamed to go outside, have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman, and it is all because of this malicious curse. I would trade absolutely everything I have to have a normal head of hair, like a guy my age should have. I would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance. I know the hair is not my only problem, but it is most definitely the core of all the other ones.I was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as I am still trying to fight for my life, hopeful to make an appointment, and although the guy there said it is still too early for me (does not mean It looks anywhere near decent) he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when I had last visited the clinic, and I looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what I have now. In fact, I was once a pretty handsome guy (though never appreciated it), but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old, sad and ugly to a point of no return.In that point of time it really does not matter whether I actually end my life or not, because I feel like I am already dead. Actually, I do not even feel like I am human anymore, just a pathetic, useless piece of rubbish. Having ""better days"" is actually the worst thing, because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse. My youth has been taken away from me and I feel doomed to be lonley and hating my appearance for the rest of my life.I have no idea what is the point of this post, but anyway, thank you for reading and have a nice rest of the week.

"Hi, I do not know why I am writing this here or anywhere at all, but I feel like a mess and do not know what to do and pheraps someone here can help me.I cannot say I have ever struggled in life, I had everything I needed to this day, my parents always suported me even when I probablt disnt deserve it, I have a social life and friends even tho I am not very social, I feel like I have every thing One would need to live right. However I do not feel good about myself, have not felt since around 7 grade. Even tho I had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future. I never tried my best in school even tho I was fully aware that I needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life, to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me. I ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows, I saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something, and there I was left behind with no purpose whatsoever. I started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself, purpose, value, right and wrong, it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion, things I had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what I now know as nihilism. I started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless, talking to people seemed meaningless to me, i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so I would not have to think about living and life in general, the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color. And that when it hit me, why do I have to live like this? All this thoughts, lonelyness, zero purpose, crying nights, what reason do I have to stay? Suicide made its home in my head from there on but I still feared deaths, there were a few times where I grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking, can I do this? What if this? What if that? I never could bring myself to do it and I always ended up cryng over how I cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle. After sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend, the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity I felt I was. The relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption, everytime she went out to party I was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks, i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night. With time and her icentive i went to college as well, my parents had to getMoney from the bank to pay for it but i felt like I was getting out of my hole, fjnnaly a light at the end of the tunnel. But it was not like that, today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life, even tho my parents made the biggest effort I still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose. And now I feel slowly faling back into that hole, I even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to ""live"" and still lack pupose. I try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism. Lately I have been feeling like a lost case, i suicide has been on my mind lately as well, i just do not know what to do, I still fear death and the worst part is that I had EVERYTHING and I messed up, i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward, i feel miserable, a failiure, and a waste of effort that was put on me. I am sorry for the long text and the bad english but I dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what I felt for at least on time in my life, thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going, oportunities will arise but please take them, make it worth it do not be like me.

"I have had anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember and from last year it is been really bad. Now this year is just pushing me over the edge. First my grandpa died then my dad got so sick he could have died and needed an emergency operation and he will need one more in a few months. Then my cat got really sick and she is still sick and I am trying so hard to get her better but I am failing. Then an animal at work that I have been really close to died while under my care. I have a partner but no friends and animals are my heart and soul. People generally repulse me. So, people might think that pet problems would not effect someone very much, but for me it totally stops my life and takes me over.The anxiety about my dad being OK is just on my mind constantly and the fact that the animal at work died under my care makes me feel so horrible and useless, I could not save him.. what the he will am I even there for then? And then my loving, lovely cat that I cannot help.. what the hell am I here for then? I wish she could just get better and I could get sick instead. I would give my life for her wellbeing if it was only possible to make the trade. I have not slept in 4 nights because I have been watching over her. And now awaits another sleepless night. And then tomorrow I have to go to work and it is killing me because ill have to leave my cat and I will not be able to watch her and I will just be a ball of anxiety while somehow working.My partner tries to be supportive but she does not really understand and when she jokes and smiles I just feel so alone.The only thing that keeps me from killing myself is how much it would hurt my parents and that I would fail my cat, she would not understand where her mommy went and then she would have to move and get a new mommy and I am responsible for her. But I am starting to feel like I am failing her anyways and someone else could be a better mommy to her and my parents are probably so tired of me and my constant nagging from worrying.Everytime I am driving I am thinking about finding a good brick wall to accelerate in to.

Last time I was in the hospital they said my CPTSD is critical and I need like the life saving help.So last week told my mom I need something more something impatient something where I can actually heal if you forgive me the right treatment. Her advice was basically stopped being a little bitch and just go back to the 24-hour hold.Then I called her 30 days ago and said I cannot fucking do this I am going to kill myself and I do not want to but I need like intense intervention right now or I am going to lose my fight.Her response was I do not know what to do but should I call the police on you......Now 2 days after which is now today, she calls me and leaves a voicemail cuz I was on the phone with two other lines already like one was I was on hold and the other one was actively like having a conversation.

To feel his warm embrace and his fingers play with my hair. To make me feel like I am worth protecting. Like I am important to at least someone. I am always fighting with myself internally. Ik that I should not have to depend on anyone for happiness. That I should be my own independent woman or whatever.

"Hey Reddit, sorry if this is too much but I really do not know where else to turn to so any advice at all would be helpful.One of my closest friends since I was 15 has been going through a lot recently, she is open about her feelings and what has happened to her and has always said she feels like her life is not worth living. We had not talked for a while since 2018 but she reached out last month and we have been hanging out a lot since then.However, she told me that at the beginning of this year she was sexually assaulted by an immediate family member and since then she has been traumatised and has developed PTSD. She told the rest of her family about this when it happened and wanted to press charges against him but they do not hear that as the perpetrator is under the age of 16, and I think this is the main reason as to her feeling this way as she told me she had always been quite close with her mother (who does not want her to press charges). Since then she has been living in a refuge as she cannot stand to be around her family, understandably, but it means that I cannot even try to call emergency services to come to her location as these places do not give out their address (even to the residents).She seems like she will go through with it as I found out she has been spending all of her money on her friends and buying people gifts, which sounds like her because she is an amazing person who has always been there for other people. And now it feels like no matter what I say or do, it is not enough and as someone who has thought the same things as her I understand that completely. She also told one of her friends that she has bought the 'equipment' to commit suicide and is planning on doing it next week (she did not specify which day as she does not want anyone stopping her) as she had tried to get through to her mother again earlier today about pressing charges but to no avail.I have spent a lot of time with her recently as it felt really good seeing her again and catching up after so many years, it is like she never left but she is about to. She reconnected me with one of my old buddies too, but since then told us that it was part of her 'bucket list.' I really do not know what to do I cannot even thin straight so I am trying to ask anyone I know for some advice, the situation she is in is a horrible one which I cannot even fathom so it feels wrong even trying to look for some way to help her as she is so insistent on what she is planning to do.If it helps with the advice, we live in the UK. Any advice or help whatsoever would be so greatly appreciated. My (M21) friend (F21) has been planning to k*ll herself next week and I do not know what to do",Suicidal

"note: this is a throwaway account specifically for this subreddit and a couple others of similar topic.----pretty much the only thing keeping me here is musicit's like music knows when you need someone, and it is genuinely the only friend that will not ever leave you behind when it eventually gets bored of you. because it will not get bored of you. music is just there. forever. whenever you need it.whoever invented music is a fucking genius.honestly i do not think i could have survived these 17 years without music. it is been so painful at times and honestly i just feel like crying when i remember everything I have lived through, especially the last 5 years. but i had music. and music got me through it all.because of all of that shit, any criticism i get from anyone hurts way more than it should. but i do not show that of course, because there is no point, as nobody would understand.but that is not the point of this post, i do not want to talk about that stuff here. maybe one day i will make a post about that stuff.my point here is that music is the best, most helpful, most loving, most comforting, most amazing friend in the whole world.and I am scared that one day i will lose interest in music, just like i lost interest in so many other things that i loved. a few years ago, i had some friends who i vented to a little. but they did not understand me like music does. and these friends all ditched me so i stopped venting to people unless i really really trust them. even then they know barely anything about me. yet here i am writing this.i do not even have to vent to music because music already knows and understands everything that you have been through.I am sorry if this makes no sense, I am so tired while writing this so it probably does not make sense.thank you for reading. it means a lot to me. music is the only true friend that will never leave you",Suicidal
"I cannot seem to do anything right. I lack awareness on all levels. I am bad at almost everything I do, I am just slow in general. I am 16 and it seems like I am surrounded by smart people even though the only reason it seems that way is because I am just such a moron. I am so self conscious about my intelligence that I can barely focus on anything without constant thoughts about killing myself. I am constantly reminded of my stupidity and I hate it. I am trying to do activities like meditation, yoga, cardio, rubix cubes, and other hobbies to get sharper. but its so hard to keep going because the struggle is way harder for a below average person like myself during mentally demanding activities. I have other problems with myself but there are too many to count. Even physically I cannot stand myself, I feel like a disappointment to my parents every time they look at me. If literally anyone sees this, please try and tell me what I can do to combat this because I am at a loss. Maybe a suggestion to boost myself mentally, because that would give me more self confidence.

"I posted this in r/depression as well, but I figure this would be more appropriate. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more.I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma.The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships.I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well.TL;DR: I am killing myself in a month and I generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living Killing Myself Soon",Suicidal

She is the only person who cares about me, nobody else gives a fuck. She is also depressed and suicidal. She has threatened suicide but said that she is still alive just beacuse of me.

I did not do anything, i just sat there for a couple of minutes and then put away the knife.

"Ever since the UK had a large country lockdown thing last year, my social life has gotten worse and sometimes I cannot even speak as I do not know what to say.Recently, I have been getting more persistent suicidal thoughts and wanting to self harm. Thankfully, my addiction to the internet has basically saved my life as I have found out what phobias are. Me having a phobia of death and pain really saves me from doing anything to hurt myself. Though, at times I get SERIOUS thoughts, but I try and consider the good things in life and turn to them for help.Another problem is that me and my parents have completely different views on mental health. I think it is looked down upon to be ""mentally unstable"" and it should be talked about more, my mum is a nurse who thinks she knows everything but she most certainly does not, and lastly (the worst of all) my dad. He tells me that I should not cry because its annoying, anxiety is a stupid thing and it is all just a phase, that I am not depressed I am just being a teenager. Speaking of what he says, I am scared of him because he would shout at me all the time when I was little (sometimes It was justified, most of the time it was not) and he tells me that I should be scared - he just does not understand that children are not supposed to be scared of their dads.Sorry this is long but, NEXT. Unfortunately on the subject of suicide, I have attempted to commit suicide. It was a couple months ago when I was in the bath.

I wonder if they get tried of me looking so sad all the time or barely hanging out with anybody.

Over the past year, I have been getting better at being able to speak up when worried, but it seems as if they are irritated and upset with me for asking for comfort so much over such stupid things. In my head, they are big and suffering and keep me up at night, but my parents always tell me that I cannot let those kind of things control me. I am trying. I am really trying.

"Hi, I am early 20s (M) in Scotland and I have been really struggling with my mental health from loneliness and isolation. This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relate/empathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid, I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadness/depression and loneliness consequently, which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of self-doubt about myself. The relationship was quite one-way I had to put a lot of love in and I was not getting anything back, I feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope. There have been other stressors as well but this seems to be the worst contributor to my sadnessIt's been a really hard time and I have been trying so hard to get out of it but it can be extremely rough sometimes. I have been paying for expensive private professional help/counselling recently that i self-referred myself to try console me through it but I think at the end of the day I really crave some new social contact and try get my confidence back again. I do not really know what my hobbies are either outside of being outdoors(vague i know) and coding which is not the most sociable thing ever lol. I have tried dating apps for weeks and to very little success. I do not know the best way to meet new people these days? in Scotland?

I guess it is just so hard to see the wood for the trees, and I do not know what to do and cannot see how things will get better. I feel like noone can tell me how to to fix it or that things will improve, which makes me feel more hopeless. I want to get out of this rut I have been in for so, so long and to feel loved/validated again and feel good about myself again, as cheesy as that may sound.

"I have been having suicidal ideation nearly every day for the past few years and the older I get, the worse it gets. At this point killing myself feels inevitable. I am taking a break from school and my student loans will be due soon which has been making me feel like I have to just do it. My parents took out tens of thousands in parent loans as well and considering I do not have a degree or a well paying job there is no way I could possibly help to pay it back. And how could I ask them to pay for that when they already are only just scraping by? Killing myself has always felt like the way things will end for me as I have a lot of trouble connecting with people and I really do not want to be alone for another fifty plus years. That being said, it has always felt far away. So now with my student loans looming I feel like its probably coming to be time and its freaking me out a bit to be honest.

I am not smart. the only thing I am good at is disappointing my parents. the only thing I have ever wanted is to make them proud but i will never do that. what is even the point of being alive if i cannot make my own family proud of me? i wish i had never been born and i could have saved my parents from all that they have to do for me. i will never give them anything but sorrow and disappointment and resentment. i should just go drown myself like my dad says when you do not look forward to most things",Depression

"Main problems are sharp pains in liver throughout the day constant loss of consciousness for two days after my overdose and my breathing has been a bit more laboured, also wrenching a bit and feeling a bit sick. I am most concerned about the liver pains as they are consistent and actually make me say ouch occasionally and I have a high pain threshold. My liver just does not feel right after this. It was a busy night when I did what I did and I did not feel like a pain to the nurses but probably was to the doctor who could not understand why I was not immediately reacting the way he wanted me to. Well I actually did I just seemed to have a delayed reaction to the drugs I took for whatever reason. I am worried about my liver. I took a pretty high dosage and I do not understand why it took a day to react. Just a couple hours before I was meant to be leaving hospital I started to strongly react to the medication I took. I had all the symptoms. Then I spent the two days immediately after taking the overdose getting all of the worst symptoms. A bit while hospitalised and mostly not. The medication was out of date and there for if i ever needed to kill myself. I would have been smarter doing this a different way because now I have no idea what I have done? Sometimes I do not care then I get a sharp pain in my liver and do not like the idea of dying slowly of cirrhosis. I suppose most people who want to die would rather just take a painless route but those are basically unavailable unless you really know what you are doing.

"I have been experiencing an increasingly hellish hell for many years and I am closely nearing the end of what I have the strength to bear. I have money saved to purchase a few acres of land in another state, but my depression, anxiety, and confusion of navigating the adult world has thus far hindered me in making this long-held dream a reality. Too scared of making a mistake, scared of risk and change, even if it is change for the better, something I know I want deep down. So to stimulate motivation, I have made a pact of life and death with myself; if I fail to aquire a new home by the latest deadline of this upcoming December 31st, I will take my own life by opiate overdose in a motel room on January 5th of next year, probably sometime in the evening. It does not help that I want to die anyway. A death pact is hardly a motivator when you are already suicidal. It seems like ending my own existence would be easier and a more certain win than anything else I have ever done as it seems as though my hopes and dreams are nothing but shattered shards of failure and regret. I want to see beauty in life, a reason to keep living, but darkness is blotting it all out now. I hope things change soon. They have to or I am going to die.

"Hi, hoping this will make me feel better. This summer has been hard. I am medicated for anxiety/depression, have a partner I love and that is so supportive, a dog that means everything to me and a safe place to live but it still feels impossible to be happy most days. I work as an RDH and that has taken a toll, especially since COVID- its exhausting. I like the perspective my job gives me, I have a great boss and coworkers but having to always be on for patients is SO draining when I feel like shit myself. Its important to me to be an empathetic provider/provide positive experiences so that is probably the hardest part. I get a lot of nervous, anxious / patients in pain and I feel like a sponge- all that gets soaked up. I wish I lived somewhere else so I felt like I am not here to pay off debt until I die. Parents are retiring soon and I just think welp, that will never be me. cannot afford good enough medical insurance to get quality care, nothing is/has ever been worth the copay.

"I have been reflecting on my life a lot lately, and I always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying I have dealt with through my life. Hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.So a little about myself, I am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in Video Games, anime and music. I have been playing video games since I was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. I grew up in a small rural town for most of my life (From when I was born to my senior year, am currently 25) and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth, free-spirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. My parents have been pretty decent, but they were never around to support me so I mostly just stayed in my room playing games. It was around the age of 4 the I first experienced any sort of bullying. A couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games I played. (I was a PlayStation kid growing and they were Nintendo kids and around 8-9 at the time this was happening) Unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.This went on till I was about 8-9 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions I see them. Elementary school was pretty uneventful as I mostly just kept to myself. Middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.In my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and I never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. We were all getting changed and I realized what was up, got really nervous because I noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that I did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change, needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that I was wearing briefs. It was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me, and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.By the time I got to my 6th grade, I only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. I was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated, so I tried to fake being cool, which did not really do anything in the long run. It was also this year where I saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school, and since I had some figured I could wear some. I remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. I went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully, who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is ""for girls"" and other verbal insults. This was the only time I ever cried in school for something like this.I feel like I had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students, even if I did not want to. In 7th grade I had a crush on another girl in my class (She was one of the only people in my class, let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person) and some of my ""friends"" physically dragged me over to her after I let them know that I had a crush on her and made me grope her breast, all the while I was begging them not to. (Thankfully she did not hate me for this)8th grade was the first time I can remember wanting to die, not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing I could just cease to exist. I started to become really jaded, I could not trust anyone save for a few friends that I barely saw because I was too busy still trying to live this ""cool"" facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. Being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. Near the end of the year, the same group of ""friends"" from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. (I do not even remember where) I took one whiff, and in the back of my head I just said ""that is it, I am done with these guys, this is not what I want to be""I left that school with one friend that I had just made that year, social anxiety and self-hatred from all the harassment. I remember that summer feeling really lonely, like I was just existing but I lost a lot of my drive and happiness.High school was better at least, there was still bullying, nothing compared to my old school but I think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things, I tried to own this ""one man wolf pack"" loner sort of shtick but deep down I just wanted to be accepted. Things ended completely by Junior year but by that point the damage was done.Nowadays I have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who I am. I still deal with the insecurities and fears from all those years ago and feel really emotionally stunted, like there is still this scared kid trapped in the body of this cold, logical body.For those who took the time, thank you so much for reading all of this, any advice on what I can do to move past my fears and insecurities are appreciated. Hopefully I did not come off as too whiny. Looking to share my story of being bullied.",Depression

"I have typed and rewritten this 100 times. Its embarrassing but here goes. Why cannot I kill myself?My life is a long story filled with ups and downs. But since I was a child I had my best friend with me. In highschool he and I started dating and 2 years ago we got married. We had no one but each other. A lot of years were just us vs the world and it felt amazing coming home to him everyday. But then I found out I was pregnant in May. Since then, he completely changed. He has cheated twice now with two different girls. I caught him both times. I have no family, no friends. I lost my job. I told my therapist what is happening and she asked why I am even seeing her still. I stopped going to therapy and I am sick of them not helping. I decided I want to end my life while I am pregnant. I know that sounds macabre and evil, i know. But no one will love the baby but me. I do not want her to grow up feeling as alone and unwanted as me. I decided to do it several days ago. I have my notes (one for my husband one for my mom) written out. Every day for 3 days now I sit down in the bed, take a blood thinner, say goodbye to my cat and lay out the notes. But one I grab the knife I just freeze. I usually stay like that until 3 when i hear my husband pull up and put everything away. This feels like the right thing to do but I just cannot do it. I do not know what to do anymore or what hope I am holding onto. What should I do? Why cannot I do it?",Suicidal

"I have been attending university for about 5 years now, bouncing between programs and failing multiple classes. This summer I was able to complete about three more courses and I could graduate with a general degree. Its about 3 days now until i would have had my last exam and I have not done schoolwork at all. This is something I am not interested in and I had no motivation to do any of my assignments or work and now its come to bite me in the ass. Luckily, I got accepted to college in September for a program I think I am interested in. I could not find it in me to push myself to do anything for this, I cannot stop thinking about how disappointed my family is going to be knowing I am a failure. The only reason I was doing it was so it would look good on my resume and to make my parents proud of me. Its so hard to watch people I went to Uni with graduate, I envy their ability to put their education before their emotions and push themselves, I could not and now that is 5 years of money and time wasted - I just want to graduate and feel accomplished. I hate myself. [22/f] I have given up on Uni and I cannot stop beating myself up",Depression
"Paradoxically, all I want is to do is to not have to do stuff. Like not having to work, which is honestly one of the biggest reasons I hate living. Any job whatsoever is hell, every single job.But you are forced to work 8 hours a day (or even more) to survive, for bills and food and such. Torture, especially if you are doing it just to not be homeless.I just have NO reasons to live. Only reason I did not off myself is because I do not want to make my parents suffer, or my cat. And I will not ever off myself, do not have it in me to do that. I guess many years of anhedonia since a relatively young age does this to you. I wish I could just lie in bed all day at least, but no, I have to endure torture for so many hours a day by having to work. Every second is torture. At this point, I am not even sure I am depressed anymore.

"I am overdue for a haircut and with everything going on in my life I really want to shave my head. Some unnecessary info about me: I am 21F. Overweight (last time I checked I was nearing 230). If I kept going with my diet Id probably be at my goal weight right now. So I am trying to do somehow lose weight again (eat less, drink more). Part of the reason why I added some info about me is the reason why I have not done it yet is because I am not only insecure but I dress like a guy so if I shave my head completely Id actually look like a guy. Hahaha I know it will get better but damn I have been in a slump for weeks now. Also, one of the main reasons why I want to shave my head is because of the bugs.

I have no idea how to get out of this pointless life, there is no point to any of this. Work yourself to death so that you can retire then die. Suicide honestly seems to be a logical short cut when you weigh the years of work and sacrifice vs the ones your supposed to enjoy later in life.

"Apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense, I am feeling emotional and I am also a bit high...I have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks, have a history of attempts, and I think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until I 'do' something about them, i.e. try to off myself. And today I have been seriously considering doing it again, and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right (dog would be taken care of) and I had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. But, ambivalence.So...my dilemma is that if I am rational enough to think that I should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital ER, then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself, so then why am I even at the ER? But if I do not take myself there, it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should I or should not I' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong (which is not necessarily any time soon, based on recent history) or I am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. And I know I would just fail again. And I cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.I know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal, so I am not asking whether you think I should go to the hospital or not, but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? I usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since I went to ER and I am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. I do not want to feel like a moron telling them I am there because I do not want to kill myself, and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. I already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like I need them to connect me with that resource. But going it alone when I am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes. &amp;#x200B;TL;DR when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it, what did you do?

"This is my first post ever talking about my depression, idk where to start. This past week I have been sick with a minor cold and while being sick it made me realize how much of a loser I am in life. I am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing I lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past. My mom has spoiled me too much growing up and I took it for granted. It really hurts me to know I have not accomplished anything in life yet just to put a smile on her face. I had a job back in early May where I working a Physical Therapy Aide position but did not even last a month there. I thought I was doing fine until I got a phone call to not come into work anymore. I cannot even hold down a job ffs. No one in my family knows I got fired yet, too embarrassed to tell them. I do not think I have lasted at any job for more than a year. I have been applying to a few places, but no responses. I think I was meant to be a loser in life. Today was the first day I broke down completely in a long time when I came into a realization that I have pretty much 0 growth since I graduated high school back in 2017. Since middle school, I always had low self-esteem. I never tried to man up. I was lucky enough to be in a 5-year relationship w my high school love. My low self-esteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when I would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc I do weight training at the gym every week since I was 17, and you would think that would build complete confidence, but the self-esteem issues are still there. I wake up late everyday in my same depressing room, open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos, gym, come back home and do the same thing. I really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. I would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment. She graduated from college a few years ago and works a job related to her career. She always gives me advice, but I would brush it off bc I am too pussy to completely open up to her.

"Last year, I had the worst day of my life. March 15, 2020, I was across the country in my dream grad program. I was two days into a semester and my colleagues from all around the country and I were all enamored with each others brilliance. Id never felt so connected to another group of people. Two days and four hours into the semester, the sudden spike of covid-19 deaths caused my school to shut down and send us all home.

He cannot be with an assault victim out of good conscience because of his inexperience, he would told me. Why could not he just tell me that he did not think I was pure enough? I actually have less experience than him, since hes kissed people and I have not. Funny how quickly he wrote me off, like I was worth literally nothing. Not enough",Depression
"This has been a long time coming. I have had depression since I was 9 years old and I am 28 now, turning 29 in November. I have decided to end it on the 20th anniversary. How can that be? I am not sure, but when I look back at my life, all I see are fleeting moments of happiness followed by long periods of misery. My family might find this so, I am not going to mention them, but the time has come. After all my attempts to get help, to get on medication, to try coping strategies, I just cannot do it anymored. Today, for the millionth time, I called out of work because I cannot take the pressure. Today, for the millionth time I turned down a guy online bc all men see me for is a good time. My overall depression leads to my lack of motivation which is why I keep losing jobs. I am pathetic and worthless. I am both lonely and alone. I have decided to call 911 right before and do it while my roommate is away. I am hoping my last days will be good ones. I am Ready",Suicidal
"So I am about to be 23 and ever since I tired 18 my family has been against me They wanted me out the day that I turned 18 which is like two days after my graduation in with a lot of physical and mental abuse from my mom and my stepdad my stepdad would beat me about whatever else he can get his hands on and then my mom will come home if my brother and I ever gave you any lip she is fine whatever she could to hit us with whether it was a spoon and a DVD slipper a shoe there was anything she could finally get hit with it so I moved out at 18 with my best friend in high school thinking that you know we had jobs lined up with the stuff that we can do for income and in reality he move me up there because he was hoping that I would be the one to get a job and take care of them so I did that for a few months while I was in Green Bay and do with us not having food and everything I SH really really bad and to the point that my girlfriend at the time will come get me. We we had to hunt geese with rocks because we had no money or food. From there I moved to Sauk city to be with my girlfriend at the time and all she did was take advantage of me. She took all my money, medications, and the worst part is her and I had gotten pregnant and she made me pay for my abortion even though I wanted to keep the kid. Before the abortion she would ask me for money which I had no issue with it at the same time she was selling nudes while she was in collage. I did not find out about that until three weeks after I had to pay for the abortion. So after that I moved to baraboo with my friends and they drained 12,000 from my bank account because I assumed we were going to go halfs on everything and in reality they used me for all my money. I have been homeless for three years and I really do not know what to do. Anyone please give me advise. I really need somone to help with what is going on Any advice is welcome",Depression

"Today was the first time I really thought about suicide. I have often thought through my life about death and imagined dying and have said things like ""i wish I was not alive"" to myself multiple times a day and have so for many years. But this was sort of a coping mechanism I think to deal with stress. I have been pretty successful in life, and probably happy by a lot of people's standards. In general i have been pretty driven and interested. I was clinically depressed about 15 years ago, but I have not had a similar episode since.However, today I felt a really different feeling when my usual thought came for the day. I did not just think ""I do not want to be alive"", I thought ""maybe I will not be soon"". I thought of some familiar fantasy of dying, but this this time it was real life. I thought about how I could enact that fantasy. Then I wondered if that was really a realistic way to die. I do not want to die painfully. And I do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards. So I spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be, all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate, making dinner, talking to my spouse, putting the kids to bed.I just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing I did to cope with how stressed I was feeling to this other, ""oh I can do this"" feeling. It was so unexpected. It was just a normal day.I have never had these thoughts before, and I just wanted to write it down somewhere. I found this subreddit in the course of the day, and I have reddit so I thought it would be as good a place as any. July 28, 2021, maybe a new era in my life started today for reasons I cannot really understand.Thanks for listening Today was the first time i really thought about suicide",Suicidal
"Untill now I was the so called ""good guy"". Always trying to be pleasant around others, always trying to help, always saying ""thank you"" and ""you are welcome"" when needed etc. Recently I decided to adopt and raise a cat. But there is something very dark that came to the surface which I did not know that existed, and I have the very hard to resist temptation to hurt my cat, watch her squeal in fear as I am being a total piece of shit to her. First few weeks were great. I may have been rough to her sometimes during those weeks but it was nothing too serious. We were always sleeping together, playing together and we were practically inseparable. She was happy, and I was happy too.But once I decided to return to the house I grew up in, where some childhood trauma events have occurred, it was like a switch flipped, and I became a monster. I became very abusive towards my cat, and I have a very hard time stopping. Now I try to keep her outside my room and encourage her to hide because there is a monster inside me, which I cannot control.And because of that, I feel like I do not deserve anyone in my life. I was being a hypocrite all along, pulling of an act, and I deserve to be alone. Hell, I feel so guilty that I want to outright die, because I cannot live with the guilt and shame because of this.I know there will be people who will hate me for what I said. And I am really scared because of what I am about to post. But then again, I have never done the right choice anyway.I deserve the hate. I am lost",Suicidal
"So my parents have this thing where they will take a long time to let minor wrongdoings go. They hold all my small inconveniences over my head and it makes me feel awful. For example, they started yelling at me for being ""ungrateful about the help they give me"" which is completely untrue by the way, and when I started to fight back, because I am done with just sitting down and taking it, they hold it over my head for at least the rest of the day. It makes me feel like nothing I do is good enough for them. How do I deal with this? Whenever I try to talk to them about anything wrong that they do, they always get angry about it. What do I do?

"I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well. TL;DR: I am killing myself in a month and I generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living Killing Myself Soon",Depression
"I never thought it is possible, but I have a case of mental illness, that is practicaly incurable. it is based on ""only"" severe emotional neglect through childhood (and adulthood) but when it is mixed up with too much responsibility from early age, it becomes incurable.I will explain. Normally in therapy patients are taught to find their inner child and nurture it the way patients have not been nurtured. This gives the restless inner child fixing experiences and after few years of inner child work, mental health gets better. But if you are neglected AND you had to take care of yourself, taking care of your inner child is just playing the trauma again, so it is not healing. It is only retraumatizing.And this mixture means constant panic-like feelings, like what a baby would feel when left on the side of the road. Panic, fear, chaos, eventually deathwish. These feelings might be on the surface or hide in dark, but they are never absent. Therefore I do not sleep. I do not enjoy. I do not connect. I do not love. There is no hope of feeling nurtured or satisfied unless someone else does the parentification. And since I am not adoptable minor, that means never. So do you know any cults with charismatic father-figures? Can be a suicide cult. Incurable mental pain",Suicidal

"I (17M) have been diagnosed with Aspergers, although my experiences are better described as high functioning autism (although I do not function at all lol), a semi-official type of Autism. Luckily, my autism was recognised very early in my life, when I was about 3/4 years old. I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (later with Aspergers). Because of my amazing parents who fought very hard for me to get the help I needed, I got special training in primary school. I not only learned how to communicate with other people, but also to control my ""explosions"", when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded (screaming, swearing, slamming with doors). I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semi-functional and make friends. However, this training had an unintended consequence, I was convinced that the only way to be accepted in society was to isolate myself when it all got too much for me. This does not always work out, and afterwards I feel really guilty, especially if it happens around people I love, because I see it leaves an impact on them. It also does not really help that I am constantly irritated, because of the pandemic, lack of sleep and maybe depression?I feel so guilty for being such an asshole, my friends and family do not deserve it, it is also the reason I feel like I do not deserve their love.

"NSFWI have been depressed since a child. I watched my grandfather die at age 4 of a heart attack in front of me, I was sexually assaulted by my neighbors and age 7 my bio dad passed away. When I was 12 one of my friends committed suicide by hanging himself in his home. I lost my paternal grandma age 18, my maternal grandma age 20 and step grandma age 21 all whom I was extremely close with. I lost my uncle a few weeks before Christmas due to a heart attack just after losing my paternal grandmother right before Thanksgiving.In 2015 my cousin was murdered (shot in the back of the head) in 2018 my paternal grandfather to a heart attack and we had to pull the plug, he died on my fathers birthday 6 February which is 6 days before my birthday. Also, in June 2018 I lost my younger brother due to a devastating car accident that left his body mangled and we found this out the day after it happened, right after my other grandfathers funeral. My brother did not have his ID on him so they could not identify him immediately.2020 I lost my aunt due to a heart attack two days after Thanksgiving. 14 January 21 I lost my mother after her battled with Covid-19. Due to having small children, one with severe respiratory issues and the pandemic I had not seen my mother. The last time I saw her alive was in early December at my aunts funeral. That was the last time I hugged her and held her hand.Forward to March and I lost another aunt, she lost her battle with leukemia.there is more death and many other reasons but my main trigger has been death/loss. I have cried because I am tired of living and want to end my life. I get angry that I have kids because I am afraid of what my loss will do to them and my wife.

I am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides, but I did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this.

"Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker. Most of my english comes from memes and series. I am 25 years old male, big loser with no education and living in a shit hole. I have been depressed since I have been concious, and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore. My father was not present when I was a kid, and because my mom had to take care of me alone, she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid. The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot, and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant, I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts. I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis. It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing, and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day. After that, I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me (this was when I was 9 yo). At my 11 years of age, I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me. The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then. All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner, and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that. I deserted my undergrad (Mechatronics) because I was scared of failing again in life, and running always seemed easier and safer (I deeply regret this now that I am older, but it is too late to go back). Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty, with no education, no good jobs prospects, nothing. I was very close to end my life a few days ago, but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything, and she convinced me to not do it. I have never tried suicide before, but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good. My current relationship is long distance. she is in another country, with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident. Because of my lack of education and preparation, it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is. We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in, and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then, and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again (yea, I know that this was a very bad decision). I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there. My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not? This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship, but now that I am compromised with someone, and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing. It really sounds ridiculous. She says that she is deeply in love with me, and would do anything to be together. I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me. I also deeply love her, and I do not think I could forgive myself ever. I want to end my life. I do not think I can fix my situation, and even so, the temptation of killing myself will ever go away. I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life, and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her. I hope that my mother, girlfriend and friends could forgive me, but maybe that is asking for too much. I definitely do not deserve any of that. Thank you for reading my story. Am at my wits' end.

"I am 19 and I feel like I have wasted the best years of my life. When I was younger I was extremely shy and scared of everything. I was scared of talking to people at my school, and talking to girls. Even though I was not ugly or something. When I went to highschool I did not really enjoy going to partys with people I did not know so I partied with my closest friends. Now when I have finished highschool I know that I wasted that time. I wish I was more outgoing, not so shy and did not spend so much time at home. I know that there is a lot of younger people here. So I want you to stop worrying and enjoy this time. Ask her/him out, you have got nothing to lose. you will get rejected? So what? Stop dreaming about things that can happen and actually do something to make them happen. I wish I asked Eve out, I did not do it but I knew that she was into me. Maybe I was wrong? I would get rejected? I do not care. Start living and maybe one day you will not feel like me.

I just wish I did not wake up in the mornings. I just miss life being easy and not having to worry about anything. My family has been homeless for half of my life just living with people. I stay in my room all day there is nothing to do when you have zero mental energy to even get out of bed or even eat. Then one of my closest friends I was living with tried killing me and my mom.

You have no time to cook a healthy meal because you come home at night and you are so exhausted from the day.

"Is anyone having a particularly bad time right now? I really need to get outside my head, and maybe gain some perspective through the problems of others. Last summer I lost my job. I have been working towards improving my symptoms, and I do see a steady improvement. A few months ago I could not sleep for more than 3 hours. Falling asleep was almost impossible. My anxiety shot through the roof, as I was having daily panic attacks (a new thing for me). I lost my job, went back to school and got my degree. I am worried all the time. I ruminate all the time. I was bedridden for a few months and I lost about 50 pounds. My muscles have atrophied. My teeth rotted as I was not caring for myself. I am in a lot of pain physically and mentally. I cry multiple times a day sometimes uncontrollably. I will be 30 in less than a year and I feel like I am already dying. All I can think of is the negative, even though I have some positives. I am relatively healthy, no serious physical diseases.I have an amazing and beautiful girlfriend. I love her more than anything and she always returns the love tenfold. She has been trying to support me during this very dark period and I feel horrible for dragging her down. When the depression and anxiety were at their peak I was considering suicide every minute of the day. I had to call the suicide hotline and the lady I talked with used a tough love approach which actually helped put things in perspective. Anyway, even though the symptoms have been improving things keep happening in the middle of my recovery that trigger the anxiety and depression. Just yesterday when I was feeling quite good about my situation, I became the victim of identity theft. Here we go again. One step forward and 10 steps back. I obsess about things, and it has been driving me crazy. There are compounding problems contributing to this hole I have dug besides my mental health. I need a kind stranger to tell me what they are going through as well so I do not feel so alone. I am hurting really bad. My heart and spirit feel broken. Anyone else?

"(Idk what subreddit to put this in, so I decided to put it in here)Why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. ""Work on your self esteem"" or ""You sound insecure"". Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just *insecure*?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure, I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure, I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday.

I do not care about spending my life on anything better then quick little bursts of dopamine like videogames, weed, sex, internet, and memes.I do not care if I live for tomorrow or die right this minute, I could not care for a single heartbeat.The only thing that keeps me alright is my boyfriend but too much of that is unhealthy too and I would die before I ruin this relationship.Just so fucking dead inside.

I have been struggling with depression and questioning who I am as a person for the last couple of years but it recently has been getting way worse. I wrote a song to express myself if anyone wanted to hear it. I know I am not supposed to do it,Depression

"At this moment, I am in no danger, because I still have fear, but I am having daily ideation of the plan. down to the last detailAs to why, the reasons are typical and boring, but let us just say I have lived enough, and it is getting harder to continue on every day. But, I still have a lot of resistance to overcome. I want to be able to do the deed in a calm, detached manner. No butterflies, no sadness, just this is my time to die.I have not attempted ever because the way I would do it will be 100% not survivable.

"It was in 2011-early 2013. I was feeling particularly empty that day for some reason. I felt sad, but the emotion felt distant. I was looking for the Sponge Bob episode ""A Flea in Her Dome"". I saw a low quality video of it and all of a sudden I started feeling down. I felt this weird nostalgic feeling, but not a good one. It was the feeling you get when your life goes by too fast despite the fact that I was only 9-11. I was crying uncontrollably all day long, but like I said my emotions felt distant. I was feeling a pain deep in my stomach and in the back of my throat. It felt like I had to forcefully exaggerate my expressions to force out the sadness. I honestly do not know how to explain it. I felt empty and like the emotions were distant and far off. I felt removed from myself. Idk how to explain this but I have felt empty inside since then and I am only 18M(almost 19).I am sorry if I explained this horribly I remember the last time I cried.",Depression
"My partner broke up with me. We dated for 8 months and were extremely co dependant. It was not a healthy relationship because she did not want to get better and I wanted her to. We met up and she is with someone else as soon as a month after, an extreme alcoholic drinking 750mls every night and I am still in love with her.The breakup is what originally sent me into the depression, but it was not just that. Where I live was going above and beyond with covid restrictions even though people were getting vaccinated and you would be fined for even seeing your family. My parents were being insane, my brother was not doing well, and it took a huge toll on me too. More than I know, I think.Then I made the impulsive decision to get an apartment right after the breakup. The move in date is September 1st and as much as I should be happy, that makes me even more depressed for some reason.I have no friends with depression, I have no one that talks to me constantly (my ex did so I am feeling extremely lonely after just getting cut off from that), and I just feel so exhausted and alone. I want to go out, but I want to be alone. I feel nothing - literally nothing. I am just a numb husk that gets stuck in depressive thought loops over and over and wakes up to panic attacks.I have been in bed for over a week now, my room is beyond disgusting, I cannot eat and look like skin and bones, and my Dad basically has to take care of me because I cannot. I have gone out once or twice but I feel nothing the whole time. I cannot live like this. I have clinical depression and have extremely intense depressive episodes multiple times a year but this is the worst one I have had since I was in fucking jr high. (I am in college now). I think I am suicidal but I am so numb and empty I cannot even tell. The healthcare system in general, let alone the mental healthcare, where I live is abysmal but I am genuinely considering calling the crisis line and getting myself admitted to the mental health ward. The only thing stopping me is how much it would affect my family.I just feel so lost and SO alone and I do not know what to do. I think I came here to just talk to more people who are struggling like me, but if you have any advice please let me know. I am so tired. I am in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life.",Depression
"I really do not want to because its honestly very depressing for me to think that at the young age of 23, I am already considering throwing away my one and only life. I wish I believed in some form of reincarnation but I honestly do not. I think that if it were possible to somehow trade my life away for another and start all over again, I would do it without hesitation. But nobody is capable of figuring out what truly lies beyond death and still be around to tell about it. Is it just an empty void or is it eternal torture what is waiting for me? I am scared to find out. I honestly do not think Ill miss anyone or anything that exists in this world. I am having trouble finding new interests to keep me entertained and I am losing the very few that I do. I love my parents, I would be devastated when the time comes when they are no longer around. I honestly do not think I could say the same about any of my siblings, any secondary family members, or anyone else in general. I have become estranged with just about everyone. Most of them just see me as a lazy bum who does not care to improve himself, and maybe they are right. But I am also not right in the head, so can you really blame me for the way that I feel? I feel alone.I have ideas on how i could get better but I am just too lazy to do anything about it. I think most of this laziness comes from how mentally strenuous some of my ideas are and whether or not it will even be worth it in the end. Id hate to give myself a bigger headache than what I already have right now, all for nothing.At this point, I find myself romanticizing the act of suicide more and more. To finally take charge of your own life and do the inevitable. I kind of hope that my life will get progressively worse just so that making the decision to commit suicide will be a lot easier. Or at least motivate me enough to finally take action into improving myself out of desperation. I am at the beginning stages of considering suicide and its making me very uncomfortable.",Suicidal

"I do not know where else to turn to. It feels like my brain hates me. I should be happy, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and clothes on my back, more than a lot of other people have. I should be able to smile, but it drains more energy out of me than I can possibly describe. The voices in my head tell me I am not good enough, I will never be good enough. Pathetic. Useless. Worthless. Stupid. waste of space, time, energy, and matter. the world would be better without me, besides what is a small screw in the grand scheme of things, the world will still spin, my family will move on. Maybe without me dragging them down, they can finally be happy. I look in the mirror and I harbor nothing but disgust and resentment for that \*thing\* looking back at me. and then it speaks to me, Pathetic. Useless. I learned at a young age, people will pretend to care about you if they can see your scars, so I cut my legs, they cannot see those, no one will ever see those. they pretend to care, and then talk behind your back, ""oh look, cutting again, how PATHETIC"" ""grow up"" ""be a man"" I have told my family about the monsters, they say its just a phase, 'its not a fucking phase I just want to feel ok, ok motherfucker now you have got my attention, I need to change a couple things', but what to change, I eat right, I exercise, literally only drink water. My dog is the only thing in this world keeping me here. I made the decision to kill myself June 23rd 2020, at 5:21 am, I tied a noose and hung it in my closet, wrote a note that no one would ever care about and stepped into my closet for what I thought was the last time, then my dog barked, and she never does that. I cannot do that to her, So I will live for her. but how Pathetic, staying alive for a dog. an animal that would forget about me in a month. I have family that would forget about me in a month, ""friends"" that do not even care now. I bring up my past to family, my parent told me its ""impossible for a man to get raped"" well, guess I am the impossible, happened twice in my life, once at 13 and again at 15, so I secluded myself away from women and now I have a hard time opening up to them when trying to get a relationship, and they do not understand that, not exactly something to bring up on a first date, and heh, never get second ones. How Pathetic, typing to a bunch of strangers who do not care. why should they. I have tried getting help, but the meds make me feel worse, all of them, the therapists push their agendas, no one is against you, they are only for themselves, but if I am not for myself, then no one is. Worthless. I have even done things that I thought id never do, I have prayed, and prayed, looking, asking for help, for the strength to get rid of my demons, my monsters, to no avail. The monster just laughs at me, Useless. I used to be smart, used to have a lot of practical knowledge, now its all superficial, Stupid. Nothing I do in this life will make any difference, the words I say will bring no impact to anyone else. all I want is for just one (1) person to read this, I suppose. but that is a lot to ask. why would they waste their time, their energy, their precious internet activity on someone so,,, Pathetic. I want to reach out, but I am just a waste of space, time, energy and matter, I do not matter. I never will, when I die, the history books will never say my name, they will never look at me, just bones in the ground turning to dust, at least ill be useful to the fungus, probably not even the right place to post this, there are so many more people in more need than I am, I made a promise, and I intend to keep it, I will not die until I give my dog the best life, its what she deserves. does not mean I do not spend every waking moment wishing, thinking, planning my death, one day just disappear, never to be seen again. I would go to Canada, in the northern forests, find a spot in the summer, I have already picked my day, June 23rd. what a good day to die, the method, I am not so sure, guns are messy, pills are unreliable, rope does the trick. If anyone has read this, I thank you, I am sorry you have decided to waste your time reading the words of some\*thing\* like me, but I thank you nonetheless.

"I have been walking around being productive, I have a boyfriend, I have emancipation papers (not filled out), I have this big plan on how I am going to go out and live life and pursue college. I have told all my friends that I am going to leave my family (which I feel like is emotionally and mentally abusive but I am not sure) and go get an apartment and finish highschool and go straight to college and then Med school. Problem is, I have not actually done any of that. This past year I got pulled out of school twice for suicide watch, my grades plummeted, I quit my sports team and I cut off most of my friends, I stopped showing up to work and I just tried to not to kill myself. Recently its been getting worse at home. My father has become more controlling, grounding me for stupid things, taking away my car, not letting me see my boyfriend or friends, gaslighting me for not spending time with him, etc. My mother has gotten better she has not manipulated me in a while so I think were fine. Her husband on the other hand, says that I am the reason my mothers health has deteriorated, both of my stepparents have said that I am the reason our family is dysfunctional. Sometimes I like to think I am stronger than others, that I have it worse than my friends, but that is not true at all. I am weaker than all of them. My life is so easy.

"that is the question I have been asking myself, for months. I am underage (less than 15) and I think I can asked myself that fricking question. I live with my mom and my two sisters, my dad live in another country with another family. But I do not care, that is not why I am asking myself that. One of my sisters (14 years old) said (when I wad 5/6) that I was a big baby, and that I just needed to suck up my problems and grow up, because that is what adults do. I was 5, why the fvck you want me to act like an adult ?! But I was little, and she was the sister I admired, so I did it. My other sister (17 years old) was the one that I was not really talking to, because of our age difference. But we had the same interest (book, anime, japan, culture...) so we started talking more and more together. But I sincerelly regret it. She thinks that just because she is older than me, she can do what my mom do (scolding me when I do something wrong and all that). And she think it, but WAY too much. Example: one of the day her best friend was home, I did some noise will drinking my chocolate milk and she smashed my head on the cup, and I started crying and bleeding. Her friend told her that she was exagerating and to say sorry or help me but no, she think it was the right thing and she does not cared. Example 2: I started fighting with her (verbally) and she pinned me against the sofa, hurting my shoulders and I pushed her in stomach so I cn go to my room. But there, my other sis (14) literally started beating me up, till I was on the floor, crying and screaming: ""stop ! It hurts ! Stop fucking beating me !!!"" And my sis (17) said: ""stop ! do not get physical !"" But she was the one pushing me on the sofa. When I called my mom, she said she did not want to know anything. Example 3: yesterday (27 july 2021) i was playing fortnite with my cousin (10) and step-sis (10). I am used to curse but they know I was sarcastic. I said shut the f up to my step sis and syam (17 yo big sis name) started yelling at me ""do not talk like that"" like i xas talking ti this bitch. Then she said things like ""y you responding"" (because that is how a conversation works) and at the end she said ""to you think I am your friend"" and i was like: ""well i do not pick people with such petsonnality as my friend"" BUT, since i wanted to finish that argument i just said ""uh... no ?"" And she smashed my head on the switch i was playing with. I screaming ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ???"" and pushed her in the stomch so that crazy would go away. In conclusion, i have a scratch on my face, that i will maybe keep 4ever. Yesterday, because of that, I scarified myself. Its been 13 days I did not do it. I do not care about the mark, but the fact she would want it on my face is what hurts. I tried to end my life multiple times, since I was 9. The first time was because a person in my family r^ped me. Since that I cannot feel pleasure in life, and even if I did forgive that person, she is still horrible with me. My sexuality is a problem. My mom said ""you are lucky I accept you"". Like if you do not think you will accept me, why you did a kid ? But some people get kicked out, so I guess I am lucky. My gender is a problem. I identify myself as a genderfluid person, but he/him pronous are the one I love the most (even if I use all pronous, even it). Who am I is a problem. I need to smile. Always. Even if I am just eating. My mom said these exact words:""Smile. I said SMILE ! Ugh !!! Why will not you smile ?? it is not like you are unhappy either ??? Do you even have a reason to not be hapoy, to smile ???"" Well do I have a reason to smile and to be happy, while I am not doing anything except eating ? And last but not least, what I asked. I never asked to be born, to live with my mother, to go see friends, to go to someone is birthday, to live, to be feed, to have a house or go to school. I only asked a few things, and one of them is to go see a therapist. I asked it. I asked it three time. But even if she said yes, she did not do anything. And so, what am i supposed to do ???I am supposed to smile if I am not ? I am supposed to stay with my mom because she fighted for me for years, even if she do not care about my mental health or well being ? I am supposed to let my sisters hit me, just because they are a few years older ? I am supposed to do things, but how can I do them if I cannot even take care of myself ? What am I supposed to do ?",Suicidal

I am just constantly imagining killing myself in brutal, vivid detail. For instance, one of the thoughts that keeps popping up is that I want to shoot myself in the head and its like I can *feel* the cold steel of a gun against my head or on the roof of my mouth and my finger squeezing the trigger, even what it would feel like when the bullet pierces my skull. And that just one scenario. In others I slit my throat or my wrists or a whole myriad of other things.I cannot escape thinking about it and I feel like actually doing it would be less traumatic than the thoughts I am having.

"I have had larger amounts of stress happen compared to now, but it feels like I have only now caved from it. I left my job about two years ago to take care of my dad while I was in school. It was hell watching him get worse without being able to do anything. I still managed to stay on top of my grades and responsibilities. He passed months ago. Nothing seemed right after, but I had to carry out his will, handle his funeral, etc. so it kept me from just sitting with my thoughts. About a week later I found out my SO was cheating with his kids mom. My grades slipped that semester, but I got them back up and got a new job. Continued repeatedly dealing with shady behavior from SO and being promised change. My mom chose this period of time to behave like she had not in years, disappeared when she met a guy and does not really come around, and cancels when I have tried to come see her. My parents divorced when I was young, she was not close with my dad.These past few weeks I feel I have let myself go. I was struggling with my classes and have just stopped working on them, not even checking the grades. Letting my ex/not ex SO continue to be around despite asking them to let me heal and move on. they have been attentive and loving and stopped drinking but it does not feel the same anymore. I do not think its fair to them because I do not have hope that were going to last and I do not know that I even feel sad about that after giving so many chances. Its not healthy for either of us when there is no trust. I procrastinate all responsibilities, and do not really see myself with a good future anymore, just getting through each day. I feel the panic of how bad I am messing up but will not do anything to start fixing it. I have just mentally checked out from everything aside from my job. I am not sure I want to see a doctor because I fear they will just send me on a journey of different medications to try. Even small tasks like calling a doctor seem strenuous. I do not want to talk to anyone I know about this because I know every person is dealing with their own problems, and cannot really help with mine anyway. Just needed to get this off my chest.

"In 2016, after living by myself, I had to come back to my parents place. I was pretty miserable because my return was the result of several disappointments and failures in a row.The 2 following years were pretty dark, I did not know what to do with myself and a childhood friend that was very dear to me kind of betrayed me and it totally broke my heart.In 2019, I finally found a job that was perfect for me. I knew the place, my boss was very understanding (regarding my shyness, anxiety etc), I was good at it, I got my first salary and the first car etc : Things were getting much better.I did not move out because I was working part time, meaning I was not earning much, and I chose to prioritise spending my little savings into a car rather than an apartment. Then my contract ended and I have been looking for a job since last January. I have been applying to jobs all over the country and oversea, super confident, but I barely get any feedback and when I do, we proceed to have an interview but then I do not hear back from anyone.I was okay with living at home because my mom and brother were still there but she divorced him (which I am happy about, my dad has been sucking the joy out of us and belittling us our entire lives), and my brother left too, so now I am stuck with my dad I cannot even look in the eyes, and broke. I was supposed to live with my mom but her new boyfriend moved in instead. That hurt too but I want to let her live her life with him, she deserves it after years of submission to my dad.I know I could try to apply to a different job that is hiring more in the meantime, but as I mentionned, I am very discreet, anxious, shy, but also clumsy, distracted, and I am pretty sure that I would be a burden and suck at anything that is not of my qualifications. I do not feel capable of doing anything I do not know alreadyIm very alone. I got a couple friends and I am thankful for them but my social life is far from being exciting and my love life is simply inexistant. I was relatively fine with it because frankly relationships scare me, so I was kind of at peace with it, but considering my current situation, that lack of love is adding to my list of what is making me feel worthless. Someone that could make my heart feel a bit lighter would not harm right now.If you read it that far : Sorry, that was a lot of self pity.

"It has been 7 years since my brother died by suicide and honestly, life has never been the same but not better. He killed himself using a gun owned by my father and left a suicide note written in japanese ( he self-studied the language). We never saw the whole note since it was surrendered together with the gun to the police and my parents never wanted to read it. After his death, they burned all of his things (laptop, books, etc.) and never talked about the reason of his death ever again. There was always a time once a year when my curiosity got the better of me (I asked them if they could get a copy of it or if the police can translate it for us) and it always ended with disastrous fights with me against my parents. I always feel like I will never have my peace of mind if I will not be able to read about the letter.In the end, I always feel like the note could be some sort of closure for our family.Today, I feel like I just want to follow my brothers footsteps. My parents became more emotionally absent. They always feel like they are right and their ideas must always be followed. I also just feel like a burden to this family. I do not even see myself alive after 5 years. I just want to die. My brother died by suicide",Depression
"You hear a lot of teens claiming that they are depressed and when you ask them why, they say it is just life. that is the same person who got nothing to worry about, financially secured, loving parents, spoiled and bright future ahead. I am a 17 year old going through the worst of hell. My father cheated on my mom. He always wanted more. He promised he would pay for my education, he can barely pay my 50$ monthly allowance. While the kids around me are holding IPhones, sipping on Starbucks daily, depressed because their favorite musician produced a sad song. My mom always expected more from me. she is a manipulative bitch. She is Satan's daughter. she is always hated me for no reason. I admit I am a mess, I do not tidy up stuff, I am not that smart, I am not as smart as her firstborn, but I try. I do try my level best, but she does not see it. I scored 7A's and a B in my middle school final year exams, and she said it was a fluke. They did the papers too easy or something like that she meant. Whenever I try to be close with my own mother, she does not see me. She will be on her phone scrolling through Facebook when I try to talk something important to her. She recently told me if I do not do good in my final year exams, she is not going to pay for my college. Her perception of good is straight A's. Online classes are not doing any good for me. She does not care about my mental health or anything. She thinks of it as a simple matter that you can get over it. Basically, she will disown me if I do not do well. Do you see the type of mother I have? She highly praises her firstborn but she does not see anything in me. I helped her a lot with with her work, but I have never heard a thank you before. But I do not know why I still keep doing it. I show that I am okay when I am fucked up in my mind. I have an elder brother, who emotionally abuses me. He reminds me that I am fat and stupid everyday. I do not know if it is his way of showing affection or not. I am not claiming that I have the worst situation of all. There are some people having far more worst than me. I admire those who stick around when it was hell for them.I am sitting here, wondering if it is all really worth fighting for. I might as well live in the afterworld. I so badly want to kill myself. I do not know what is stopping me from doing it. Do I have anyone? No. Some people say that I will meet someone great in the future. What if I do wait, and she does not show up? Am I going to die waiting? I might as well die now when I have no one. At least I am not a burden for my mother if I die. Maybe then she will finally be happy. If you want to tell me that things will be better, do not. do not waste your time, it will never be okay. Depression",Suicidal

"I have been postinf here lately. Idk, I think I am just trying to release some pressure. I think I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted. I grew up with zero friends, no friends at all. I felt sad about it for several years... but I feel like this no more. Getting hookups on tinder, making temporary friends, casual chat with other Xbox players and never talking with them again. I think I stopped GAFOS. Yes, it is good to exchange some messages and stuff, but I just do not care about other people's feelings anymore. I became a cynical person. My depression got worse over time and now I am do not care about what I say, what I do. Not trying to be edgy, trust me. But I think I got to a point where I am dead inside and I do not care if people see it anymore. I have two friends (I met both of them here. Good people, I hope we can still talk, love ya), but I simply do not care about others. I feel no empathy, no remorse, nothing. I know, I should seek help and blah, blah, blah. But the world is just... I fought for my life many years. Tried to seek help, went to therapy, that kind of stuff. But I just cannot see any hope. I go outside and I feel sick. People is just so selfish, ignorant and not a single one of them gives a fuck about others.I worked as a paramedic for a couple of years, donated to charities, tried to be a good person. But the world took me down. I do not know, I think this might be it. This is my life from now on. Not feeling anything. Enjoying my loneliness and feeling empty at the same time. This is it. This is it... I do not know if I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted or just getting used to it. Becoming a cynical person pt.1",Depression

So I doubt Ill hurt them by leaving, they will prob be better off if I left anyways. All I need now is to work up the courage to finally end it, which I am having a hard time with, I am scared of the pain, but I think some pain is worth never feeling again.

"I do not tend to talk to my mother about my mental health because we have not been too close over the years. we have only recently begun to have a relationship again after a falling out. She knows about my PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc because it is all rooted in the things I experienced because of her or other family members. During a recent interaction, she said she could sense I was going through a tough time and that it must be because I have never prayed to Jesus properly to take it all away. It felt so insulting because as the neglect, abuse, and pain I experienced as a child were happening I prayed my heart out through tears only for nothing to happen. I really am in a dark place at the moment and being told that it is my fault for not being good enough for her God has just been so disheartening.

"Mainly saying that statement in regards to people like parents and other loved ones who are supposed to care more than anyone else does and who all too frequently cares less than anyone else does (that is how it was for me at least). If people are not truly caring about how you feel, and most people in the world truly do not care about anyone but themselves, find somewhere else you can open up at and consider helping others to do the same. Opening up on the internet is the only thing that helps me to feel better, opening up to friends and family never helped me out at all. I am alone but people on the internet have been helping me to feel less alone and I appreciate that a lot. I cut myself a lot and I am not embarrassed about it or ashamed of it. It helps me to feel less suicidal, and its the only thing that does that for me. I leave my cuts and scars out in the open for all to see. I do not hide it anymore. I want to traumatize everyone with the realization of how much they truly do not care. Most people are basically just happy to watch people they act like they care about suffer and die and I want them all to remember that the rest of their lives.

"I so desperately want this to be over. I despise every last thing about myself. I am 30, and I have never experienced any kind romantic or sexual intimacy, because I am an ugly gay man and completely inept when it comes to dating (I have no experience). I have been so poor that I cannot feed myself. My career as a professional musician has gone down the tubes because of the pandemic, and I am stuck with a new job that gives me intense anxiety and amplifies my self-hatred. Nobody in my life has any idea it has gotten this bad, and I do not want to reach out to friends or family, because I am sick of the well-intentioned responses that make me feel to blame, or worse about myself.While I do blame myself for quite a lot, I do not blame myself for wanting to die. This world really fucking sucks. I have no hope for society in general - late-stage capitalism and climate change are the terminal cancer of humanity, and I am sure that it is people like me that are going to suffer the worst deaths.I cannot say I have not tried to get better. I have had aloof unsympathetic therapists over the years who have prescribed me medicine I end up not being able to afford. But I still tried. Yesterday, I called down a list 20 therapists covered by my insurance the other day to see if they were accepting new patients and not one of them called me back. I guess I just really do not believe anyone is really equipped, capable, or willing to help me out of this.The obstacles keeping me from killing myself are insurmountable, like knowing the effect it would have on my family, my cat, and the lack of a riskless/painless method. So for now, I guess I am just stuck in this unbearable existence. Being able to kill myself is just as ludicrous of a goal as me finding any level of real or sustainable happiness. I do not know what to do with that other than writhe in agony until my natural time comes. Hell is real, and I am here. the definition of hell",Suicidal
"I cried for the first time in years, the summer class i depended on told me i was not eligible and i could not follow the course anymore after two weeks of learning i enjoyed. My school functions on a modular system which is extremely flawed towards students with undiagnosed ADHD and little autonomy. I love learning but my school does not have teachers, we have modules, 60-130 pages of self-learning. This system where students advance at their own pace is a nightmare for people with un medicated ADHD like me. In part to why i loved my summer class so much was because the teacher would talk to you and guide you through the subject. I wish i had changed schools earlier in my highschool career, its too late for all that. Being a maximum one year behind was my goal and i would have reached it if i had finished 8th grade science when i was 14. In 9th grade they removed my science and social studies subjects to focus on the more ""important"" ones, same for 10th grade. Why would they do this if you need them to graduate? I have planned suicide this whole year, delaying it with the thought that if i finish this summer class i will only have to do two years in one. My second option now gone, I have never been closer to sneaking out and jumping off an abandoned parking lot nearby. I have hit a dead end. I will not graduate and I will not go to college. i will be 16 doing 8th grade science. putting me 3 years behind.",Suicidal
I had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself. I must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night. Thankfully I did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time. My wife and I drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends. Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good. I hate myself so much for what I have become and yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself. Instead just wishing it changes on its own. Even killing myself I often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something. How awful is that? I am so lazy and lately I cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore. We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent. At the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so I do not feel as bad. I keep wishing I was a better person and yet never taking any action. I am the only one that can make a change. It does not just happen but I am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything. Someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop. I am just looking to get this off of my chest - please disregard,Suicidal

"My names Joey. Ever since about 4th grade I have had anxiety because my teacher was a total prick and he would yell at the class and be mentally abusive as fuck to us. So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends, so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too, not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder, probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 3/4 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all, could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute, hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopram(antidepressant ssri), and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever, because i thought i was feel better, and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious, agitated, panicky, and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep.

Because of that, my brain decided to go full on stupid since 6th grade. The funny part is that i get reminded of that a lot, in school for instance, people know I have autism (asperger) and they ALWAYS expect me to be some kind of genius and then get disappointed right in front of me (one big reason why I hate human beings). I also lost all the human fear of death, like, in 2017 i got threatened with a knife by the bully I beated the day before. He came from behind me (that is what sh-) with a sharpened knife touching me while saying he would kill me, and I said that he should do it fast then because if i got that knife I was going to pull his guts out with it. And he just ran away and hid from me everyday in school. So anyway, that is it, I will go listen to Soundgarden, Joy Division and Misfits all day, like always. Bye Fear of the D(eath)ark.",Depression

"Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission - indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. ~ Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Cannot find the source)The most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us, I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me, I have a silly idea that maybe, when the Norse, Greeks, Egyptians, Celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after (because surely they did), they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note, I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course, he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it, of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again, they are in Odin's hall, or at Arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. Or at the least, have a good story to tell. To bring it back, I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. We should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.After all, No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving, and you will love after life",Depression

Hey guys I am new here so I really do not know what I should talk about. I am 19 years old and I am suicidal. Every night I try to kill myself but end up failing badly that which frustrates me. Yesterday was the day that it finally dawned upon me that I wanted to end it all. I have never had anyone to get me through this except for myself and my bipolar disorder. Not even my family try or reach out to me so I am hoping to get good advice here on Reddit. Well mainly because it is my Dad causing these suicidal tendencies. I cannot even do the things I love anymore. I cannot even enjoy one of my games properly because of these thoughts of feeling utterly useless. I hope this reaches out the people that can help me. Because I truly am suffering. 19 years Old Suicidal,Suicidal

"I plan to die around the end of November, I know what date I am going to do it and I have some ideas on how I am going to die. I chose November because my big important essay is due, and I do not want to waste my effort from writing the first and second drafts. Another reason is because I was suppose to die on the same day a few years ago but I had to go somewhere.I have been feeling like shit for years, especially this summer. My old therapist ( last meeting was 3 years ago, 9th grade, first suicide attempt ) gave me meds that did not even work ( 50mg and only 8 tablets, and its fucking expensive ) and his last advice was to ""have fun"". Yeah thanks a lot. I have been coping in a really bad way, but I do not know if I am ready to give it up.School-wise I am doing fine, but my parents are hell-bent on making me go to college in my home country ( because the school gave me the wrong term 3 results ) and I do not want to go there because of its conservative laws and I have views that can get me killed or shunned, a shit ton of victim-blaming and overall I just want to go far away from my parents because they treat me like I am 5. My mom insists that I stay at home and go to online-school when I am in college, and it made everything worse. I said to myself ""I would rather kill myself than be with them"" I do not know what major I want to be in, I just want to move out. I do not know why, but this subreddit makes me feel safe for telling all of this. I do not know where to get better advice.

"I want to make some things clear first. English is not my native language (I am not from English-speaking country) so I apologise if you find harsh mistakes in my post or if I mention something inappropriate for this particular community or in general (if it is something really important please let me know and I will fix it). Also, my username was suggested by Reddit.As it says in the title, I am a 21 years old male. I have been living with my grandparents basically since I was born. The desicion that I would live with them instead of my mother was obviously made when I was not really conscious about it. I still have my mother but I do not want to live with her and she does not express a will for that either, not that I would take this offer. I do not even want to talk with this person.With these things said, I am moving to the problems I have. Now I will mention the ones that, while still affecting me in a negative matter, I do not see as primary but rather as secondary. Saying that I mean that I can live with them or even try to deal with them in my future by myself. They are here just for a bigger picture, not much else.1. I 100% have extreme social anxiety. This is why I was not able to continue my study in university. Well, not only this, actually, but also because it was not free and also I did not see any perspectives with my anxiety working a job that would require any social interaction, which means any job outside of the Internet. I found a way around it, so this is dealt with. I just have to study for it and I should have some possible income in future working online.2. I have zero friends. Like, absolutely no one, even online. It makes things harder, but I learned to accept it, and now I think I do not even need them. But that is why I am writing my problems here.3. I do not think a therapist will help me. As I continue, I think you will understand why I think like that.And moving on, here is the primary problem I would like to receive an advice on:I am afraid that I HAVE to live with my grandparents for the rest of THEIR lives. I am the only person living with them right now, and all the people from my family have their own little 'families'. The reason because I think they would not be able to normally live on on their own is because of their problems. My grandfather drinks alcohol every month for 1-2 weeks straight and of course this causes stress for the whole family (but no one is able to fix it), mostly for my grandmother. She has a form of cancer, having which life can be sustained mostly without the need of hospitalisation, though she still needs to be in a hospital every 3-4 weeks for a week. You could notice the similarity between times when my grandfather drinks and my grandmother goes to hospital, but I have to tell you these facts do not have much to do with each other, he was drinking all the time before my grandmother was revealed to have cancer anyways. Well, hearing all that, I do not seem to be a good person, right? Like, being raised by my grandparents and not wanting to express some gratitude? Yes, and I do not feel like I am a good person either. I do not want to blame everything on the others, my fault is also big here.I did not have a bad childhood. Neither a good one. I do not remember much of it, even being only three years out of it. But there is not a single good thing I remember from it, only bad and embarassing things. My grandparents did not make a normal attempt at trying to raise me, I feel like I was raised by myself. Just providing me with food and roof until I magically become an adult. And I did not ask them for anything either, I did not even have a smartphone before I entered university when it became a nessecity. Graduating from school, I thought I would kill myself, but I did not. It was more than a thought and a little less than an attempt. did not have the bravery. Thinking back on that, it was pretty comforting, not trying to improve anything in your life, thinking you would be dead anyways when life strikes you with the need to become a socially acceptable person.Yes, I am an egoist. I want to live by myself, for myself, alone. In a crappy apartment, with no real life contacts, working online and only going outside to buy food. I would even be fine if I had to give 50% of my income to my family if the other 50% can pay me for rent and food. I am sure I would be happy this way. What, is there no place for egoists in our society? Do I have to live the same crappy life all my damn family is living? Or is this just me being depressed about my life, who does not understand other people, who are not depressed. Like, what THESE people are living for?The moment that made me write this post happened a couple of days ago. My grandmother knocked on my door and said that she was screaming my name several times and that she did not feel well and needed me to bring her water. I think I was listeting to music that moment, not really loud (I can understand now why I am not listeting to music at higher volume, it is the moments like this). And my grandfather was unconsious from all the fucking alcohol at the time. The only thing I said to her was that I would hear her if she was screaming. This was literally the first time she was feeling like that in several MONTHS. I feel like I do not have a single minute to relax, I am always stressed because something like this can happen and I always can be interrupted even if it is not shit like that. Like, I feel that if I just tell everyone to fuck off and let me study in peace, I would have much more motivation to actually study and not stare into the fucking screen waiting for something to happen. But I cannot do that. I did not make an impression of being such a person. I act like I am fine and everything is fine. Not that someone actually cares if I am fine or not.You think if I am saying all that I actually did consider asking them if I can move out in future or not. I did not. I am afraid to. But I think that they will that I can. What will happen then? Currently I am the only helping my grandmother in our huge fucking garden and I did a lot of work there by myself. Her health is progressively worsening, and my grandfather continues to drink alcohol. So the things are going to get even worse without me being around.I would love to be a person who would say 'fuck all of that'. Can I be that person? What should I do? I ask these questions mostly to myself, but if you read that far into my post I would be happy to hear your opinion or advice on my situation. Thanks. 21M and need an advice",Depression
I fell for my straight friend and its the worst thing ever. We hang out and watch movies together sometimes and those are the happiest moments of my life. I feel genuinely happy when I am with him but once I am alone again I fall right back into depression. Hanging out with him is the only thing that still brings me joy and I am terrified of losing him. I cannot stop thinking about him. I feel like I do not live at all when I am not with him so I just keep remembering the things we did together. I know Ill never be more than a friend to him no matter how much I wish I could. I have told him I had feelings for him before but he just brushed it off and pretended it never happened. Sometimes I wonder if he actually cares about me or if I mean anything to him. Loving him hurts so much but I do not know how to stop. I wish I could not feel love,Depression
"21M. So. I have been feeling depressed, very anxious and very low the past while. I grew up in a abusive household until I was 18, I moved in with my sister for 3 years and that turned toxic and it did not work out (she was angry, hatred, thinks she still hates me), I moved into student accommodation yesterday and I am still overwhelmed and depressed. I have been like this I was a little kid. but what is happened over the past few days just made me feel so low.My family were basically just my brother and sister. My sister now thinks I am backstabbing her for leaving. I tried to explain but she got over sensitive and angry, it is for the best. We were living in a 1 bedroom small flat. She was annoyed and unhappy over time. So I decided to leave, but she was not having any of it.So I got the bus an hour away from home to student accommodation. I got off the bus, ran to the bathroom and took a panic attack. I was there for 45 mins. Left walked round town and checked in to the accomodation. did not eat anything just spent most of the day annoyed and crying. So I was sitting for hours last night and this morning just anxiously looking to click that 'call' button on the support line. I explained my situation. They asked questions, asked about my GP and I agreed to have another assessment. They said it was a suicide line, but I have dark feelings, I feel hopeless alot, pretty much every day since I was no age. But I could not bring myself to end it, I just want the pain to end.It felt ok taking the first step. I know I needed help for years. I do not know what to do with the sister situation. I am still very low. But if anyone else is feeling low or suicidal. If this quiet, socially anxious weirdo like me can do it, anyone of you can I rung a support group",Depression

I am so confused and lonely. just as info I am a 17 y/o female.i have no idea if i even have depression but reading all of your stories, i recognize myself in most of them so i guess I am one of you. I have been experiencing extreme self-hatred for the past 5 years, triggered by a tragic event in my life and then developing rapidly. its like my thoughts are my biggest enemy and I am constantly bringing myself down for the things i do and the way i look.generally, i do not share personal thoughts with people, its actually the first time i am speaking about this. i just ignored it but lately its been getting so troublesome i cannot sleep and I am always in a bad mood. suicidal thoughts have been coming up as well which scares me a lot.furthermore, i just feel apathy towards everything and everyone. yesterday i got my first job offer and i just felt numb. i know I am not worthy and i do not deserve it so i just did not tell anyone about it even if it was an achievement. same thing with good grades, i just do not care anymore. guilt has also been my best friend throughout these years. something happens and then i just put the guilt on myself. its like i know it straightaway even before considering the situation.its just getting worse after every day and i am really lost. thanks for reading and sorry i bothered you with my thoughts. just another depressed buddy here",Depression

I am a nightshift NICU RN for almost 4 years and I hate going to work. I believe I am very introverted. I am not a people person, hell, even my husband talks too much for me sometimes. I dislike going to work, I dislike the babies, I dislike the parents. there is no passion there at all. I just never want to be there. However, I am not sure if I even remember what its like to feel anything other than what I constantly feel, which is nothing. I am worried that this is baseline for me.

I am currently in the job market looking to explore different nursing jobs, away from bedside that I might enjoy. I am looking into working for an insurance company to do utilization review. I have an interview today and I am nervous because if I do not get this job, I have nothing else lined up and I definitely will become depressed if I am not already.

"Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day (at least). I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing , but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost , I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year , it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all , I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now , I play games almost everyday (for 2 hours or so) and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how , I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot , I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it , I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it , just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield , that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though , I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks (energy drinks , coca cola , pepsi and alike) for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music , which was perfect because every producer encourages that , its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 , what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself.

"If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present, I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself, trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve, if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still, trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase, I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day, I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way, one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way, that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment, to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived, nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else, nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be, lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time, all we are today is hurdles, paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality, where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing, nothing more than a figment of your mind, nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone, lifeless and empty, nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope, hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb, worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings, I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride, fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life. (I will warn you this post is not going to be a happy ending)",Depression

"Feels like the an episode of a soap opera, but the title pretty much sums it up.I am 24 now, and started attending university at 18.

During this time my gf of three years broke up with me over Facebook while I was sitting in a hospital bed waiting for an MRI, my grandad had a heart failure and died within 12 hours, and a week after leaving hospital for the final time my Mother confesses she was diagnosed with breast cancer about a month prior (she survived luckily).It took two years of feeling sorry for myself to try tinder, and there I met the most amazing person I am now engaged to, they convinced me to go back to University but closer to home as the Uni I was attending had Campuses across the UK.And so I did, and had an incredible time, got to travel to other counties to tour, was lucky enough to work with an artist who I now have work with on Spotify (huge personal victory) and since have released music with the band I am a active member of which was probably the proudest moment of my life. However, I have diagnosed ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Depression and Anxiety, book smarts just is not my forte, but I usually get by, until a global pandemic happens and I had to do my final year at home in my bedroom, this was my kryptonite, but I was still moving along fine. Up until about an hour ago, my father was taken to hospital by ambulance last Monday, traumatic stuff but we have a family history of being unwell constantly so I managed to not let it drop me getting these final pieces done. He called about an hour ago to tell me they were finally able to get a better understanding of what happened and confirm it is Lung Cancer.I do not know why is was the final straw but I have no idea how to handle this new level of nothingness My Dad just got diagnosed with cancer 22 hours before my final deadline for my degree",Depression
"I have been living the same day on repeat for about as long as i can remember, without trying to sound cliche I am in a hole that is just too deep to crawl out from. I do not know what to do to fix it and the longer I am alone just doing the same thing over and over the less i care which creates and endless cycle.I hate posting this shit on reddit because i know I am going to get into an argument with some guy and he will use it against me but yeah, in theory i should be someone who is able to thrive and create a decent life for themselves, but i just do not care anymore, years of being unable to create and maintain basic human relationships and social isolation kind of ruined me as a person.And as I have searched around, no one seems to have any real solution to this. Its always the same, well no one ever said it was easy rome was not built in a day well! The situation",Depression
"The memories I suppressed for so long suddenly triggered today. I remembered how I used to feel like I was trapped in my own world and how i was suicidal in junior school, at around age 10. I remember how my mum used to go into rage at mistakes i would make or me being annoying. I remembered how mum would tell me to put my arm out for her to hit me, and if i pulled my arm back in fear, she would threaten to hit me even harder. I was really fucked up back then. Every other night Id think about running away, never having to face anyone who would hurt me or berate me or make fun of me like my classmates and teachers at school would or like my mum would at home. I think today was the day my old self that i had abandoned to heal finally came back to haunt me. Just needed to write this down. I just needed to write this down",Depression

"Things were better than good they were great. I spent 14 months, happy, for the first time in 29 years I actually had a happy period in my life, I was sorting stuff out, wed spoke of a future together, a family, Id been talking to a life counsellor and even became optimistic and started letting go of bad moments to keep my mind clear day to day.I drove over to hers after getting some good news that would enable our future, Id made up my mind where Id take her to propose next year, and then that was that. She did not see a future for us.I have barely slept or ate. I keep taking diphenhydramine to try to sleep but I am just taking more and more now to try and not have to deal with the mess inside my head, and still not sleeping. I am heartbroken, and I think this is leading back to the depression that plagued me before. I keep thinking I am soon to be 30, and I have nothing, no one. Everything in my life I have either pissed away or subconsciously ruined.I hate the person I see in the mirror.I keep thinking what is the point to carry on, but I do not even think I could manage going through with anything, let alone even talk to anyone about it - I just feel like I am pathetic for feeling like this.

"When I am by myself with my thoughts I always start feeling really sad and lonely and depressed. I am an introvert(or ambivert) and I love being alone but there is also always a part of me that feels like something is missing and then I get depressed and anxious So far in the summer I have been pretty busy with my internship and hanging out with friends which means I felt this feeling less than before summer started. This for a moment made me feel that maybe my mental health was improving. However, I finished my internship last week and this week I am spending more time at home and less time with friends. My plan was to get school work done(because of procrastination, I have not) but idk I have began feeling sad again for no reason. I think its because I do not have the distraction of hanging out with people anymore to ignore my thoughts. Does anyone feel this too? Any suggestions to stop?

"Hi am 24 and I have been trying to figure out my career. I am a very creative person ( atleast I think that) since I make electronic music, play tabla( Indian instrument) and sing. Along with that I am a very emotional personal and care about small things a lot. I think I feel things very intensely even if its a small feeling of love, anger, hat etc. My problem is I have started losing interest in things. Some days back I was really excited to make music which I did but lost interest in 2 days. Then I was interested in making a product that is environmental friendly and lost interest in a few days. I just lose interest in everything. I need suggestions on how I can be more patient and figure out things for myself. I do not want to be that human who would go for a shit ass job and work there 9-5.

"My boyfriend is convinced that I am his soulmate; he brings it up at least twice a week. I would agree that I was meant to be with him except for one problem: I am certain that I am going to snap and kms one day. I do love him and we do talk about our future together. It makes us both really happy, but secretly I feel so guilty deep down because I know its very likely that all those dreams are going to come crashing down when I snap and decide to get it done once and for all. We did talk about having kids but I am afraid I will pass on my mental issues (not sure if they are genetic or not because I was abused as a child for about a decade) and also I would hate to create whole new people and then crush them by killing myself AFTER they are born. He keeps telling me that he will never be normal again if I do go ahead with it, but I am so FUCKING EXHAUSTED. One failed attempt last year and I am still here on this shit earth. How can I help him? I would like to minimise emotional damage. We met on a dating app so maybe I could find him another gf or something. Or I could be such a bitch to him that he actually becomes happy at the thought of my death? Feeling GUILTY over potentially committing suicide, how can I help boyfriend?",Suicidal

I am so tired of struggling with my mental health. It always seems like I am searching for help and not receiving it. Nothing in this world makes me want to live anymore and I really want to kill myself. I am angry that I was forced to be born just to be emotionally neglected and sexually abused as a child. I am still living with the trauma which is extremely hard because I am forced to live with the person who abused me when I was 6. I am desperately searching for therapists who work in trauma but my insurance is not helping me pay for it. I cannot afford to pay out ot pocket. If I do not get the help I need to heal from all of the shit that is happened to me I know I will end my life. I would rather die a million times than be forced to live in such an evil world...the thought of going to sleep and never waking up to my life is a blessing unlike any other. Life is misery,Suicidal

I tried phrasing it but it does not search what I want. I may be just dumb but i had a fucking rampage scrolling.So why everything seems pretty all of a sudden. Why am I crying like an idiot. And why i just know what I want to do for once in life. I feel like walking to my destination. And walking. And walking. there is a fucking storm coming and idc. I am afraid of storms but i feel safe. And i already prepared everything. And idk if I should give a tiny warning to my friends. Or should I just go. I feel like thanking but they might suspect something. Idk honestly.

"I was on ssri for about 3 years when I decided I did not need them anymore in spring this year.I felt great on them and they helped me profoundly.

(never felt that before but I was on ssri the last few years). Now I feel mild symptoms of my depression coming back. I can still do my daily tasks, do sports, eat healthy and other activities but they are not as fun anymore and my job starts to annoy me so much.I really struggle to find out if these feelings are just normal since I am going through a stressfull phase and have not been able to experience these feelings as I do now because I was on medication, or if I am just depressed again and maybe need it.Has anyone else experienced something like this?

My question is who is it OK to talk to? Everyone in me life has either met him or will likely meet him at some point so I do not want to talk to someone when he would not want them to know.

I was completely fine and confident before that - a nice social group of friends that I made almost everywhere I went. People used to compliment me for my good looks and charm and it made me more confident. However after the breakup things started going downhill. I am not sure if it is the lockdown and quarantine that made me this way.I literally hate meeting people now. People give me anxiety. I force myself to attend meetup plans made by some 4-5 friends that are left. I feel tired to pick up calls from friends, my phone stays on silent all the time. I do not open social media at all and even if I do, all the messages I get are left unanswered. I cannot even do daily chores which involve interacting with people like going to the shop to buy groceries or visiting the barber. Somehow, I push myself to do it. I want to join the gym and start working out again but I am afraid of all the other people at the gym. I am well over my ex girlfriend and do not feel anything about her or the breakup. But , I do refrain from meeting our old mutual friends. My sleep schedule is messed up, I sleep at 1:30 am and wake up at 10:30 am. Previously, I was diagnosed with migraine. Now that I stay at home all day I do not get them. But socialising or going out gives me stress migraines. I know this is not normal and I want to get out of all this. This is a genuine cry for help.

Nope two more scams that further irritated me (fun). Fine, I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text (no response for days). Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know, my school work began to pile up and was now behind (awesome!) But the funny thing is, the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever, my ex(who hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with) dmed me months after our last talk. Ok, I am not upset or angry at her, she changed alot and is happy with her new bf (something I was hoping she would get) but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her, I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I (should not have done this) mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new life(mind you I wished for her happiness) because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope.

"I do not want to be ""smart"" i just want to be the average person who does not think so different than the others. I was told by multiple tests made by professionals that I have a higher IQ but to me that just means that I think too different from other people (which I have noticed) to be able to fit into society and I also think a lot about suicide i want to be a normal dumb person who is happy in their ignorance bubble and does not think how cool suicide would be because he is too dumb toIts hard to explain I hope someone understood Sorry for my bad english I am spanish I just want to be normal",Suicidal

"I have plans for my future. I am happy about them, excited even. I am going to start college in a year or two. I have every good thing right at my doorstep tbh, but I woke up today with a blue body I do not know how else to put it. Its been a few days that I have been feeling this day, but today was a very prominent day when I felt blue, almost as if my veins and arteries are carrying a liquid called depression. Every step felt heavy. I had my blood tests done a few hours ago, and honestly, a part of me almost expected blue liquid to come out. Or black, maybe. I guess it was a moment of stupid imagination, but I felt so empty and hollow that it felt alien to expect my body would react in a humanly way. All my plans are very competitive, and yes, I am incredibly optimistic about my future goals. But somewhere at the back of my head, I have my suicide planned out.

"I am suffering from depression and have been taking professional help as well. I have a few really bad days where I feel like though I want to get my work done, I am unable to as I have no motivation and I just want to lie down or sleep. This makes me question myself, is it really depression who is making my task impossible or am I using depression just as an excuse to avoid work. I am confused, anxious and frustrated with myself all the time but since I am on meds, I am able to have a little control over my emotions.I think I had Depression since my teenage years but it was left undiagnosed. I have read so much on how to deal with depression and tried different approaches but nothing seem to work. Which reinforces my doubt that maybe I am faking depression as I can use it as an excuse as I am not making progress in getting out of it and maybe I like to stay in depression so I do not have to do any work. But at the same time I never tell anyone at work that I am depressed so maybe I am not faking after all. Everything is so confusing. Whatever this is, I do not think Ill ever be able to get out of this phase. I do not want to stay depressed but I cannot get myself out of it",Depression
"So introduction I guess.. my name is Michael and I am 20 yo. I live in Slovakia though I would be surprised if anybody knew where that is located. And I am struggling with..I do not know maybe deppresion?The problems started like long time ago back when I was still a child. My mum hated the fuck out of my dad and for some reason my dad hated her too. My dad is like the typical stereotype guy who thinks that woman should be in kitchen taking care of her husband. He was and still is to be honest addicted to alcohol. I remember when I was a child and my mum had to go away for a couple of days that everytime my dad stepped through front door I prayed to god because I was always afraid that he arrives drunk again. I was so genuinely happy when he did not and I always hid in my closet when he did. In school I was not very popular. I am the kind of guy who thinks that if you have the means, if you have the option and ability to help somebody you should by all means do that. Of course people tend to take advantage of that. Everytime they needed something I would do it eventhough if it meant that I had to spent 4 hours doing their homework or writing an essay. Of course I was bullied too when they did not need me because why the fuck not right I deserved that. I did not have a single true friend everybody I considered to be my friends they insulted me and humilliated me most of the time and I did not like it. I was so alone that I just decided that I had to have a friend. And that is when my schizophrenia probably started.I made myself a friend. He is called Martin Ladec I even created him a facebook account so I could chat with him because I had always wanted to have friend that I could chat with on facebook. Everytime I was alone I talked to him. My imaginary best friend. It all started like nothing too serious every conversation I had with him always played in my head like I only imagined that I was talking to him because I had known that he was not real. But then I started talking out loud to him.. It just went like this I do not really know how to explain it properly. I just sat on the ground and started crying and telling him how I was feeling but after I was done talking I got up smiled at the spot where I had been crying and tried to reassure the spot you know like if I was Martin cheering up Michael. After some time I got better but then I started hearing voices it was around 8th or 9th grade. They were telling me how pitiful I was, that I should kill myself that everybody hated me. I started to feel really deppressed and it was not helping when the actual people were telling me how pitiful I am and how they hated me. So at the end of elementary school my mind was shattered like glass into so many parts. Part that wants to kill me, other part who argues with the first part and telling me to live, Martin and myself.Then the high school came and I found new friends..like true friends. I liked them so much and they seemed to like me too. There was this particular guy that I enjoyed spending my time with we had so much in common. He loved the same type of music I did, movies, TV series and so on. Of course I had fallen in love with him. I did not even realized that I was gay but when I did I just went along with it. But I loved and still I love him so much..I guess I was really obsessed with him. I was jealous everytime he went out with somebody else ( of course i did not tell him I am not dumb I knew it would ruin everything) I was thinking of him everytime I went to bed and everytime I woke up. He had a best friend, our classmate, and the three of us started hanging out a lot. It got to a point when we had like really deep shit conversation and I remember that the other guy ( not the one I love ) told me ( because he could see that I had been struggling ) : ,,The stupidest thing that a person can do when he has some problems is that he never tells anyone about those problems. Talk about it."" and then the guy I loved said : ,,We are telling everything to each other. Tell us."" And I told them because I believed in them. I told them about the voices and about Martin and everything. It went fine it seemed they believed me but of course.. shit had to get worse. ( for the sake of this the guy I love is : T and his best friend is : S)At one point I do not know what happened but S accused me of lying. He said that nothing that happened to me never really happened to me and that I like the attention I am getting because of that and I just want people to pity me. He told other guys in my class and so I became the guy who is constantly lying, exaggerating and deppressed. I never stopped talking to them though. I understood that this shit is really hard to believe. T was still my number 1 friend because he seemed that he still believed me. I started to love him even more. I have always had money I did not even know how. From insurance, when my grandma and aunt died and what they left me. So always when I needed or wanted something I had it. And he did not have the luck he had like no money. Like he was not poor or anything but when he wanted Converse for example he could not afford. And I felt selfish because I had the money and he did not so I felt like it would be really selfish of me not to buy things for him. I bought him those. And trousers. And jackets. And games on ps4 ( which by the waay I bought just so I could play with him ). I remember that once he told me how much he dreamed of getting a new computer but his mum did not let him have it. So I literally started building my own new pc for 600 eventhough the one I currently had was completely fine. The old one I had cost me around 500. I told I am that I had built myself a new pc so I can give him my old one. For free. And I did. I literally spent on him around 600 because I gave him my monitor because he did not have one and I had to buy myself a new one. And I still was so happy when I bought those things for him and gave those things to him. I loved him so much like this is probably the true love you know.Then last year came and it all went to shit. It was my last year on my school and we had a party the entire class after Stukova. ( Stukova is like the Ball you have in last year of high school. After Stukova you have Dozvuky where all students just drink a lot ). S dated my classmate but they broke up before Dozvuky. I was really good friend with S' ex at that time. I am not going to explain what happened exactly this post is long enough even without those details but basically S "" fooled around "" with two girls. Two girls his ex hated the most. She was really sad and I was talking to her the entire time. After Dozvuky and everything I met him and he told me that I really fucked up. He told me that I disgust him and if I feel hurt that I deserve it. He blamed me for something I did not do. He did not want me to explain to him and he stopped talking to me. In the same week every guy from our class stopped talking to me including T and I realized that he told them his version and they all feel same as him about me. It could not come in worse moment. I was feeling during this time deppressed a lot. I had a friend ( M ) She was like my best friend after S and T. She knew that I was gay and she knew that I loved T. Still she fooled around with him when we had parties. When I was there. 3 times. Everytime she did it she told me that she was sorry and promised me she would never do it again. And she did it two more times. One time i was in the same bed as T and M and they started making out next to me. It was the worst feeling ever because I loved him so much and she knew and still she did it. I was heartbroken and defeated and I started cutting myself. And then S dumped me because of the misunderstanding and every guy dumped me and I was alone again. Fortunately I am not that stupid and I realized that I coudln't continue like this. I am proud of myself that I realized that I need professional help because most people cannot do it.So I started looking for a psychologist at first.Someone to talk to. I tried 9 different ones. And they all told me the same thing. Only time can help. I did the Rorschach test numerous times and still they were not able to find anything wrong with me eventhough my every goddamn answer was really deppressing, negative and not positive at all. I cut myself. I hear voices telling me that I should kill myself or the ones that hurt me. I created an imaginary friend. For fuck sake even I as a patient was able to realize that something is a bit fucking fishy about me. They did not help. One psychologist even tried to touch my thigh. So that much for proffessional help. So I started looking for a psychiatrist . I told him the same story and he gave me pills. Arisppa. It did not help. The best part is that I told him that I had told S about my voices and stuff and how I hurt felt when he did not believe me and accused me of being a drama queen and guess what did the fucking psychiatrist asked? "" Michael, are you telling me the truth? Do you really hear the voices or have you made this all up just to skip school or be different? To let people pity you?"" Is this even possible in modern world? in which fucking dimension would sane psychiatrist ask such a dumb question? I snapped and I started laughing hysterically after that. I was laughing at my place for good 3 hours and then I started crying. And laughing after that. Some people just insult those who kill themselves and say that it is selfish decision. I totally understand suicide now. I have problems I accept that. I wanted help I desperatelly needed help but everything is against me. In this world if you are not selfish bastard you cannot be happy. This world is not made for people like me. it is really easy to say that "" get some help"" because apparently nobody can help. Like I do not even know if anybody is going to read this or not. But if some lost sould read this entire novel to the end just wanted to let you know that do not worry I promise I WILL NOT kill myself. I tried sure but I am not strong enough to do that. Besides my paranoid me thinks that it would make other guys happy and I do not want to give them this satisfaction.Honestly I do not know what I expected from this. I do not know if I want your help because I know you cannot help me. But I tried everything. Psychologists, psychiatrists, telling friends, group therapies, fucking taiwan mantras to calm my mind, tropical teas and herbs to soothe my mind. Nothing worked so I just thought fuck it let us give it a shot. Maybe miracle will happen. do not know what else to do so I just leave it up here",Depression

"Yesterday was the straw for me. My councillor had already advised me to try them because I just keep spiralling, getting a boost from our session and then it all going out the window before the next session.

Struggling with the constant voices in my head, minor jobs just being overwhelming have been the run of the mill.But yesterday I flat out insulted a close friend. The only one who had really been there for me. He got a girlfriend just as I lost mine. I am full of bitterness and resentment. I have always been a good mate, never want to step on toes. It was completely out of character and like watching a car crash in slow motion. Trying to push people away out of fear? Out of mercy because I think I am just draining to know? I have no idea.I verbally attacked him and his girlfriend who I have never met. Even talked shit because she had a kid with some else after they split and he went running back and looks after someone elses kid.But anyway, called the doctor today. Got some anti depressants to hopefully help. Really scared of losing my libido, but the horniness and want for my ex has also been torture. So maybe not a bad thing? Just less on my mind hopefully.

After being closeted for about 7 years, I told my parents who I still live with that I am nonbinary (I am 19 and Amab if that helps)They did say it was okay. They are fine with make up and accessories. They do not want me to dress how I want because of my little brother who is almost 10. I feel like I cannot fully be me and I feel so trapped. I just feel like I cannot fully embrace me. it is bad enough that I cannot go to work how I want (I am a auto mechanic they would rip me to shreds) and I do not have anyone to do it with because I broke up with my girlfriend because of how she was treating me.

"So...I feel unsure about posting this because I am not sure if it is too good to be true... or maybe people will not believe me. But I think I am going to be ok and I want to share what I think really, finally worked. I have major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and C-PTSD from years of childhood sexualising abuse and violence. I drink too much, I hate myself. I have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. Drugs, booze, sex.... you know how it goes. The last few months have beeny worst. I constantly thought about offing myself.Last December I contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. I connected with her instantly. We spoke about why I drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as I have and are used to going through the motions. She talked to me about a process called The Richards Trauma Process (TRTP). it is 3 sessions. Session 1: stop self sabotageSession 2: address and leave behind the traumaSession 3: set yourself up for the future. It does not retraumatize you. I have done EMDR, CBT and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. Who wants to go through those events again??I did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost $1200 and I had quit my job. But I was finally in a position to do it.Between Sessions 1 and 3 I have gone from severe depression, severe anxiety and moderate stress to ZERO depression, zero anxiety and severe stress. We figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. So Session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. Tonight my kids were little shits and I did not care. I was fine. I did not snap. I did not cry. I did not descend into a panic attack like I have so many times before. I waited for them, then we did puzzles and listened to music. Oh...and I went for a run this morning for the first time in months! I do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. Who even am I without trauma and mental illness. I think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. I look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. No knot in the stomach. No chest tightness. No heaviness in my body. it is as if I am looking into someone else's life. Not my own. I hope this helps someone. It has brought me back to life. TRTP - Holy shit.",Depression
"it is going to be a long one. My parents have a tough relationship and I am very used to them quarreling. Since when I am about 16, they got into a particularly big fight which I witnessed many arguments. Although they never fight physically or used foul language, the way my mum talks is extremely offensive, degrading and condescending. My dad tends to be the weaker one in our family and would be the one who compromise usually (though not easily). I did not realize how have all these affected me until I got into university (I am 21 now) and lived on campus, never once thought life would be so stress-free and peaceful without them.Since I am small, my mum stemmed the idea in me that I must compete for her love with my younger brother, and for a long time I disliked, even hated him, possibly because of all the constant competition and comparing going on. An example would be that if my mum and I are in an argument, she would verbally express affection for my brother and make sure I know she favors him over me. Although probably my dad and my brother disagrees with her actions, her long-time dominant role in our family made them turn a blind eye in these cases.Going back to my parents, in the middle of almost all of their arguments, my mum would definitely ask me to take a side and have to condemn my father outright. If I do not do so, she would make me a villain as well and I would have to apologize or get scold at later, although the matter of the argument does not relate to me at all. I hated to be squeezed in the middle of their fights and would often cry and scream for them to shut up. Very hurting words like ""you should just go die"" ""your dad does not want you anymore"" or ""it is all your fault"" still rings in my ear although years have passed after them. Probably a few months ago, I found myself getting extra irritable to noises, and not once I got so irritated I almost cried when a friend is talking to me (though I had a long day). I also noticing having more frequent thoughts of skipping social settings and wanting to just curl up in my bed. In addition, I also have stronger feeling than ever that my boyfriend would just leave me, again for no reason. (it is another question which I always ponder at, whether I am insecure in romantic relationships due to my family or past experiences, since my past bad experiences could be related to my family too? but that is for another day)Then recently, I cried in a restaurant eating with my parents since they would not talk to each other nor to me after quarreling about trivial matters. Even if my mum would respond to some of my questions, it would be expressed in a sour and rude manner. I just felt like I am being treated like shit for nothing. Sadly, although they both saw me crying, they pretended that they have seen nothing and carried on with their lunches in silence. I could not stop crying and ran away, which my mother came after me saying things like ""why do you have to make a big fuss"" ""you did not stand up for me when I was in an argument"", etc. I did not look back and went straight to my boyfriend.Days after, till today, I still have bad mood swings that made me want to cry in public, feeling empty anger that I do not know the reason of. I am tired even though I slept a lot and did not want to talk at all. I have been through phases like these years ago but never this strong. What is my problem and should I get help? What can I do in the meantime? Thanks for getting through this whole thing, as english is my second language, I hope the grammar is not too bad.

"I am a 15M. I smoke weed as a way to cope with my anxiety and depression that gets worse at night. I also use it as a way to fall asleep easier. My dad found my weed last night and told me he was dissappointed, he said it is not a good way to deal with things. He said he cannot force me what to do or what not to do, but he trusted me enough and handed it back to me. I do not know what to feel about that. Right now, my dad is also having troubles with my mom, and sadly my little sister got stuck in the crossfire. My dad is barely talking to anyone like he used to. He does this very often. When he gets angry, he shuts himself off and does not talk to anyone. He probably has a mental illness of some sort, he is a very complex person. My mom once told him to go see a psychiatrist but he refused to because that is just how he is. He does not have a good relationship with his own father, which might be a because or something.I also recently got diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety and got prescribed with Lexapro. I have been taking them for a week now. My mother is the only person I can always talk to but I cannot tell her about the weed thing because I got caught before in school and she knew. I want to explain to my dad about everything but knowing that he is the person that he is, a part of me also does not want to open up to him. he is a sensitive person, something so slight can trigger him to the point of shutting himself off from his family. Smoking weed has always been that barrier between me appreciating life and jumping off a cliff. I do not know if I should continue smoking or not, I feel so guilty if l smoke because I know my dad is probably stressed about this situation also. I am pretty well known in my city, I know alot of people but that does not help either. I cannot trust anyone at all. I have only 2 real friends, my best friend and his girlfriend. I am so young, I do not know why I am feeling this way, it is so overwhelming. I just want to sleep all day and never wake up. I want to kill myself but in a way that noone would be sad about. I know there is people that care about me. My mom does. My dad does. My friends do. But when you are suicidal, nothing really even matter anymore. I feel like I cannot take this. it is so overwhelming. I just want someone to read this and help me understand myself better because I barely know myself anymore. I hope someone reads this to the very end",Depression

But if I do not try |one more time| then Id have nothing left keeping me here. I am out of reasons to keep me here. I feel like I am caped in this hollow body of a girl I used to remember. Every time I look in the mirror, I am reminded just how broken I am. I see her face and remember how happy she used to be. I remember how full of life she was. She was a ray of light and sunshine, and I am reminded how dark and empty her eyes now are. Her sleepless nights are leaving their trail under her eyes. The loss of appetite has diminished her wardrobe, all the clothes she used to love to wear- now fall off her body. I am reminded she is empty and the walls are caving in. The walls in this body get smaller and smaller I cannot breath, I feel like I am suffocating and no one even understands. I am right here dying slowly and you cannot even see.

"Nobody give two shits about people who bring no value to them. This is something we as suicidal people know the most about. Everyone, including in some cases, parents (in my case at least), do not give two flying fucks about you, your presence, or your life, unless your value outweighs the mental costs that they have to ""undergo"" to be around you. however, the second you show any negative emotion, they are the first ones to shit on you, to belittle you, and negate all resemblance of emotion, because they would rather believe their made up reality, rather than understand the truth.What kind of a shitty person would rather kick you to the curb, in order to save face, rather than help when something goes wrong.My mother has openly stated that she only had me when she found out I was a boy, because of her being the youngest of her siblings, and that she was the one who bore the first grandson to my grandfather (we are an Indian family who moved to the US before I was born, they had me and my brother, then we moved back because my father had died), and apparently that was a big deal to my grandfather.Its got me so fucked up, that I literally feel the need to justify my existence by picking up skills that will be useful in the future (I am good with computer, I tinker with linux a lot, and I can disassemble and reassemble a laptop).What kind of parent justifies this but saying that it is right to own me simply because I was born to her. What kind of parent belittles their child to the extent that they do not even fully comprehend the effect of what they are doing.I am done with this life. I am done with this existence, and honestly, I am done with this universe, knowing that no matter how many times I die and am reincarnated (wishful thinking, I know that when I die I am just going to be erased from existence like I never even mattered), that there will always be another person who is going through more than I am.

Just go lock yourself in the bedroom again and pretend to be good around others. you told ur parents but they do not care, no one cares for you, you ugly fat motherfucker, no girl will ever like to be with you. you deserve to die. Just fuckin' die and end this shit once and for all. ""I honestly do not want any sympathy at this point. Ik I am responsible for everything, I have been responsible for everything that has went wrong with me. guilt and shame r going to kill me someday, I guess that day is coming soon. I am sorry that I made you read such a long paragraph that does not even matter(does not even make sense, I am just insane. No, I am just a dramatic piece of shit) . I really hope you all have a nice day ahead. To all the people suffering with any type of mental illness, I hope God gives you the strength to survive through it, I believe you r strong enough. Once again, I am extremely sorry for my rant. I have just gone insane maybe(nah tryna push my responsibilities once again). Just downvote this post. Peace Just Fuckin' Die",Depression

"Having depression and/or anxieties can fck you up so badly that it changes all the life you have now. How can you accept the things that you cannot change? Things you know will have consequences in your life, things that you cannot just simply ""move forward"" and ignore because it is affecting you now and will affect you later. Nevertheless, you do not have the option to act for a change because it cannot be changed anymore. How do you act upon this feeling? Knowing that no matter how much you want to improve and move forward, it is already part of your life. It cannot be changed nor ignored. It cannot be glorified that ""it is an important part of your life"" because you know you are much better off without them. How do you deal with this in the right approach? How do you accept the things that broke you forever?",Depression

"Hi all,The last few years have been awful to me. Although I am 19 and at a very good university, life is so tough right now. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, not because of any external factors, but just because me lmao. My family has always been fine, and we are close and supportive, and my friend groups over the years know what is happened.The past 4 summers, however, have been awful and I am losing everyone I love.3 years ago, I had a complete mental breakdown over my thoughts spiralling, and nearly committed suicide. I did not tell any friends about this, and was too mentally exhausted to socialise over most of the summer, and I lost many friends by just not seeing them.2 years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. It was sad as any breakup is, but was made worse by false rumours she had made about me. We broke up just entering into summer break, and that summer was really tough. I worked on myself over summer, but I became very anxious about what everyone thought about me, and I lost a lot of my humour.Last year, of course covid hit, so we were in lockdown, which was isolating. Just to add fire to my already depreciating mental state, my dad was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April. Thankfully that is one of the safer cancers to have, but I would not ever wish the experience on anyone. Over this summer, he had rounds of radiotherapy and scans and it was so stressful. I joined uni later this year and, although I made a fair few friends, my dad was always on my mind and I could not enjoy myself as much.This summer, I have been framed for a completely horrid allegation, and the investigation process is so painful and mentally exhausting. I am trying my hardest to stay positive but it has taken away my social battery completely, and once again, summer has not been kind to me. To add to this, my dad had gotten a recurrence on his cancer, and his voice box had to be taken out, and he was in hospital for 2 months recoveringHas anyone else had years of just horrible stuff happen, and what advice can you give to try and get through all of this. Also, what professional help do you think would be appropriate (I have tried antidepressants but i did not like them) Sorry for the long read, but thanks How do you look past all of the bad things life gives you",Depression

"Maybe the song Achilles come down has it right.it is just so weird how people treat relationships, how easily they discart it for something ""better"" how much being with someone gives you hope until it is just another reason to commit suicide, not like a broken heart will necessarily make you jump, but for a time in my life I even tried pursuing a relationship because I know it never works with me, because I knew they made me want to kill myself but it was never enough, and it seemed that no amount of birthday wishes would bring me closer to not existing anymore.But you know, despite all the bullshit, the little broken pieces of me i left scattered behind and just giving up on everything I still manage to stumble into someone I love by accident, and this one is truly special, and different in a way none of my relationships was before. But it just makes me wonder, how ironic it would be if it just broke appart and left me so much less than the little I am now, if hope and love just serve as entries when the main dish is always misery and hopeless, and I wonder, if everything falls appart again, will I just be someone looking for hope like an addict looks for his next fix or will I be lucky enough to never wake up again.

"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain",Suicidal

If I had not taken years to dwell on it, years in which I have acheived absolutely nothing, done absolutely nothing, I might have been able to rest and find peace so much sooner. I felt like I have not slept in years, my relationship with food is only more horrendous and the only thing that forces me outside is an exercise addiction.

I have spent them inside for the most part, isolating myself from people and trying to sort myself out on my own. I cut people off, and other people got bored and left, and now my only good friends live thousands of miles away and I will probably never even get to meet them. I know this is my fault, and I should have tried harder to connect with people, but I just could not. It felt impossible to hold onto those who mattered.

By 10 years old I had already told myself that I was ready to die, not that I wanted to,but I was ready.This made me really unrelatable to my peers,I acted like a little old man and never got to experience a normal childhood.By my high-school years everybody thought I was a crackhead because I was always nervous,my clothes were dirty,and I never had good shoes, this led to me accepting that I was a loner,but I am full of social desire.All this made me really cold and unfeeling on the outside,I am really bad at expressing my emotions and anytime someone is fighting or in an argument I revert to the same frozen state of my childhood.Fast forward to now,I am 20 years old and I am the only source of income in my family,my step-dad has been in prison for 3 years on a 15 year bid.

I got into science streams. 2019 was the worst year for me would be an understatement. I was accused of cheating, stealing stuff by a teacher. I was removed as the head prefect of my school and president of the red crescent society of my school. I was falling into depression. I started to skip classes. Thoughts of hurting myself have always been in my mind. At the end of 2019, all the accusations thrown at me were proven wrong but people still treated me like I am some kind of a bad person. I just want everything to end but my friends always stop me. So in my last year of high school, I studied hard, despite the pandemic. I worked my ass off. My friends were worried about me. I just wanted to get out of my house and pursue my dream job. I wanted to become a doctor. In The SPM examination, I got 7A 3B, and 2C. ( The Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia, or the Malaysian Certificate of Education, is a national examination taken by all fifth-form secondary school students in Malaysia. ) I was exictied and thrilled, except for my parents who were angry that i got 3B and 2C. Well i applied for Matriculation in my country. Unfortunately, I did not get in bcuz my country has this quota system where only 90 % of Bumiputera ( Bumiputra is a Malaysian term to describe the Malay race and other indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia, and used particularly in Malaysia. ) while only 10% of Non-Bumi are allowed despite being a citizen of malaysia. I was very disapointed. I wanted to pursue A levels but my family denied. So i went for the second best option STPM, ( STPM is a pre-university examination in Malaysia. ). I got in science stream and i was happy. I later found out my parents have changed my stream to arts as they want me to become a lawyer. I wanted to become a doctor. When i ask the school administrators for advice they told me i cannot do anything. Nothing can be changed. I feel numb. I feel the world has stopped. I feel nothing is meaningful anymore. I feel my life has ended. I wanted to end all of this paain. I cannot bare anymore. I do not want my friends to feel guilty that its their fault. i just want to dissapear. I cannot handdle this pain and toture. i just want to pursue my dream but there is no other way. I feel i am going to hurt myself. I do not know what to do. I feel the world has stopped and I just want to dissapear",Suicidal
"Since a child I have always neglected food. I am in my 20s (m) and was hoping Id grow out of it by now. I am quite thin and forget to eat regularly. I tell people I have eaten when I have not, sometimes I buy food just to satisfy others and secretly throw it out. My stomach always aches and hurts, I am not sure if its the lack of food or what is stopping me from eating (I think both). It kills me to see my family and friends, who constantly offer me food. Anyways, I have been to over 10 specialists doctors (probably more like 20 honestly) and spent over $5k trying to get help but cannot seem to get over this. I think its partly medical and mentally related. Anyways rant over thanks. Any advice greatly appreciated (and yes I have tried medicinal cannabis and lots of pharmacy meds). Body",Depression
"I need to be dead, but I cannot bring myself to commit suicide. But I made a plan, a week ago, and at first I wanted to wait untill my sister leaves for uni, but I do not think Ill be able to make it for this long. I honestly never thought it would come to this, I said I wanted to be dead, I prayed to die countless of times, but always thought I am too much of a wuss to actually kill myself I am not so sure anymore. I cannot keep up a job. I started working now after almost a year of sitting at home, but I am already breaking down and had panic attack before and at work. I am living with my father even though I will be 21 soon. I do not even know what to say and how to explain myself to others anymore. I have no future, no plans, no nothing. All my energy goes into trying to survive, into getting through the day, into not killing myself. I cannot deal with people. I have severe social anxiety. No one understands me, and I cannot do therapy because I just go mute everytime. I am terrified of going to the doctors. I am not even registered with a GP. (I am not from the UK) I have taken Fluoxetine, Lamotrigine (when I was still in school, likely as a misuderstandimg because I would not say anything, and I would miss my appointments because my mother would not take me there) and Sertraline (last year, privately, through online appointments because I am incapable of going to a real doctors office) and none od them worked. They made me feel nauseous and gave me headaches. I also went through an episode of unexplained joint and bone pains, that made me lay on bed and cry from the pain. I have trouble sleeping. I had times where I did not eat much, and now I am overeating and bingeing, cannot get myself to cook real food or clean. I got fat, and hate myself. I cannot stand it anymore. I am tired and want it to finally end. it is such a horrible feeling because I KNOW how I will die, I know I WILL kill myself. it is just a matter of time, I just do not know when exactly it will happen.

Clearly, I am poor as hell - otherwise Id hire someone to deal with this.And please do not judge me, I was 12/13 when I signed the confession because the officers said I would never see my family again if I did not, and when the court finalized it I was 15.

"Severe content warning for mentions of eating disorders and emotional abuse.I have had binge eating disorder for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was a child, I would eat large amounts of food to cope with stress, as I have been in an abusive household my whole life. I have always known this was a problem, and I have tried to lose weight, but my eating habits feel uncontrollable. they have caused many problems, and in 2019, I was diagnosed with morbid obesity.I knew my problems were getting more grave than ever, and my parents rather than trying to help in any way, have scolded me, yelled at me and denied it being related to my mental health, and even denied that I had any mental health problems.It was not until late 2020 where they started taking my mental health even remotely seriously as I had a severe depressive episode that resulted in me not eating. I then got a professional counselor, and I was diagnosed with depression, general anxiety, and PTSD. I was prescribed prozac/fluoxetine to help with this. Even after getting therapy and professional help, my eating habits have not changed. Fluoexetine has also helped me gain more weight.Recently I have been struggling to breathe. Whenever I realized that my health has gotten this bad, I started bawling. I started to feel like my days are limited and that I am going to die before I could turn things around.Truly, I do not want to die. I have many friends I care for dearly and I want to at least live somewhat of a life for myself and escape my abusive home. However, I do not know if I will be able to make things better for myself, and I looked up the costs of oxygen, in which costs more a day than my family makes per month. Making me feel like I have no other options than to die slowly and painfully or by my own hands. tl;dr: I have had horrible eating habits since childhood that my abusive family has refused to get me help for it for a long time that have gotten so bad that they have resulted in breathing problems, and I cannot afford medical help so I feel as if all I can do is die slowly or end my own life myself.

I wanted really cool cards like my partner has and it is just all junky cards and I feel so let down.This caused a fight with my partner because I was being extremely negative. we have been having a lot of fights recently that are always caused by my negativity.

"I have struggled with depression for many years now. My go-to strategy to get help was to reach out to my friends and talk about it. But I use that too much, it became that I was ranting to them every day, sometimes multiple times a day, and that pushed away almost all of my friends. So I am working on not reaching out as much. But, I think that support from my friends would be really helpful, I still want some kind of support. What are some ideas for how my friends can help/support me so that I feel supported, but that it does not hurt them in the process? How can friends support me?",Depression
"I do not know how much longer I can keep going. The wasted effort the looping thoughts that no matter how hard I try to tell myself they are not real, or that they do not mean anything about me, keep tearing me down and effecting me.

Why do I have to make everything so difficult, if I could just decide that is one less problem that I have to deal with. I want to tell him that I am going through some shit right now, but what am I supposed to tell him. Sorry coach my asshole mom's boyfriend broke up with her smashed a bunch of shit, yelled and kicked her and I just sat in my room like a pussy. Then to top it off she experienced everything that I do, feeling restless, little to no sleep and always nervous. Then she had the nerve to complain to me about it and get back with him not even a month later. For ten years that man scared me to the point where I did not want to be in the same room as him, and when I finally felt free from worrying about being yelled at or having to hear the dogs get beaten, she pulls him right back into our life, telling me one day I am going to understand. + a bunch of other stupid stuff.

"I honestly do not know.I do not know if contemplating suicide as an option relentlessly makes me suicidal or not.I do not know what would happen if I committed suicide.What I do know is that I want to commit suicide, because damn, life is hard. Soaking up everyone elses emotions is hard. Feeling like you are too young to die is hard.Losing those that you have called friends is hard. Cutting contact is hard. Being called indecisive and unable to say goodbye and move on is hard. Being ignored is hard. Being in a relationship, romantic or otherwise, is hard.I have had really bad experiences in the past. One of who I thought were my closest buddies gaslighted me for years. I was always bullied and ignored. I have recently moved to another school and things have been easier, but I am afraid to trust anyone, so I have been pushing people away because the easier it is to convince myself that I am not their friend makes it easier when I mess up and the relationship burns down. And I have dropped hints everywhere that I want support but nobody ever noticed. Even going to a therapist is hard because I do not trust the therapist enough to tell her anything about how I am feeling because that information invariably ends up in my parents hand. And I do not trust my parents with a single atom in my body. Because some part of teenage me does not trust adults. Because I do not want anyone to worry about me, because in the end this is my burden to carry.So yeah. I have been contemplating suicide. I have even written a draft of a letter to share with certain people I have once felt even remotely close to trusting. I have been getting no sleep at all lately. I have researched the afterlife to try and see what it may be like after I die. So what now?I guess there are two options. To do it, or not to.that is all I wanted to share.

"So I have been diagnosed with panic disorder, severe depression, and I also have horrible anger issues that just make me feel like shit afterwards. For a few years now my depression and anger have taken a bad fucking turn. it is gotten so bad that I have been pounding brick walls and getting into fights as a form of self harm/punishment (stupid I know but it also keeps the anger in check).About four months ago I stopped taking my meds, I mean they barely helped me anyway. No one really knows what is been going on with me and I think that is for the best. I am about to start college in about a month and I am extremely tempted to kill myself before then.Days just blure together and the faces of friends start to lose their meaning. I honestly feel like I am out of options at this point and I do not know what to do. I wish the best for everyone that reads this but I do not believe that anything good is in the cards for me.

I have been taking my meds and since then my depression has kind of frozen. I did not feel anything and was complaining numb and disassociating.

I have talked to people before but I have had it thrown back in my face. So I do not feel very trusting anymore.

"I have been with my partner for nearly 3 yrs now and we have never once had sex, hes been really patient with me. While we have never had vaginal intercourse we have done other things, and I sometimes struggle with depression bringing down my libido. But for weeks now I have been struggling having any sort of intimacy with him. Last time I broke down crying as we made out with his body over me, he did not notice as the lights were out. And he began to move his hands and the combination of anxiety and fear of him feeling my cuts (started self harming recently) made me run, I left immediately and told him I could not do it. Prior to that I have had tears run down before but this time it was more and I felt as if I was suffocating. I love him, and I am attracted to him but when this happens it feels like I am not there, almost like I am just watching myself but I have no control over my body. I know I can tell him to stop at any moment but it feels as if I am mute and cannot bring myself to do so. He does not even know I struggle with depression, no one does, he just thinks I am saving myself or waiting for the right time. We were relatively young when we started dating as well so it makes sense that we have not had any relations during the 3 yrs. its scary when I disassociate, I know hes someone I trust and love but it feels like rape in a way. I am not comparing the two but I do feel powerless, and its not even his fault. I cannot be intimate",Depression
"Again, I really do not want to seem like an asshole, because I know some people are just trying to help, but its incredibly frustrating to me and I often feel patronized in spite of myself.

"I currently live in the you.S. with my mother and my partner is from Poland. I would like to move in with them but it is a huge step that has given me a lot of anxiety. I think its time for me to commit to the decision or else I will end my life.I currently live with my mother. she is quite abusive in a few ways and she constantly controls my life. I am a gamer so of course I love to game and I can spend a lot of time on that. My anxiety and depression is preventing me from being able to continue college. I had to drop out after one semester due to it causing me to attempt suicide. I still do not feel ready to go back. I am 19 and due to the fact that I live under my mothers roof its unfortunately her house and her rules. I do not know if she means well the majority of the time. She says she wants the best for me and wants me to be something in life but just because I am not going to college right now does not mean I will never go, I am just not ready. She constantly takes her anger out on me and never apologizes. I often feel uncomfortable living with her and stay locked alone in my room. She gets upset if I sleep in late but that is my choice because I am not feeling well. I often stay up late and sleep in late, why should it matter to her?My experience with therapy has been awful. It took me contacting 10 therapists to even get one response. During therapy I have just been judged and my issues compared with others, and it has never helped. I had one psychiatrist tell me to just stop gaming completely when I use it to cope with how shit life is. My psychiatrist told me yesterday that my partner will leave me for being useless and not having a job. She also told me that if my mother were to die Id be taken advantage of and used in the system. It feels so fucked up that she would say those things to me. All I could do was cry. If I am being honest, I wanted to shout fuck you and punch her, but I somehow had restraint not to do that.I am 19. I have a lot left to life (and honestly I fucking hope I do not but Ill just say that because of reality) and just because I do not have a job nor am attending college now does not mean I am worthless. I do not understand why my life has to be controlled and I have to be forced to do things I am not ready for. College makes me suicidal, and so does my mother. I feel like its time to move out.The reason I am coming here to post about this is because is it really the right choice? I know there will be yes and nos, but I want to hear what others opinions are. I have been with my partner for just over 2 years and I have been thinking about this major decision for over a year. It gives me quite a bit of anxiety. I have never been to Poland, but we have met twice (would have been more if it were not due to the pandemic). I do not have anywhere else to go. My family is toxic as hell and none of my friends really have space for me to be there. I also will not be able to bring my cats with me if I choose to go. it will be a huge lifestyle change too. My partner has constantly reassured me that they will take care of me and I will have time to improve my mental health before I start making any big steps into the work force or college. Honestly, I feel like Id feel more comfortable doing things if I was there with them, because I love them and I am comfortable with them. I just do not know if making a drastic change to a different country will be worth it in the long run. I do want to move away from my mother but its so far and its so different. I do not want to judge. I just hope that I will be happy if I make that choice, even though I know it will be a lot of stress and anxiety. I am hoping that it will improve my mental health in the long run and allow me to actually be able to control my life and be able to breathe. Maybe Ill actually find a competent therapist and psychiatrist there that are not pieces of shit.I am writing this calm as fuck right now but in reality my brain is spinning. I do not want to go back to my piece-of-shit psychiatrist in a week. If I cannot move out, I genuinely will kill myself, and I feel like moving is the better choice because knowing me Id fail and turn into a vegetable. : )I genuinely do want to die all the time, but I feel like if I can actually enjoy life it would be worthwhile staying at the same time. I want to make the right choice. I can move out but if I do not Ill kill myself",Suicidal

Right when I started singing, I thought about how much I just want to stop doing anything anyone wants me to do. I do not want to sing. I do not want to be complimented. I do not want to be in a world full of people who wish the best for me and always want me to become something great, when all I want to do is die.I am not looking forward to anything.

"I will be using letters instead of names.my friend N is the reason I am alive today, we have been friends for a long time and hes the closest friend i have ever had. i introduced him to my online friend T a month or two ago and they have been inseparable ever since. i cannot text either of them because they say that they cannot talk because they are talking to the other. so I am all by myself now. i tried to kill myself a little while ago but it did not work. i thought, ""well even if it did not work, maybe something will change"".nothing has changed. in fact things have only gotten worse. I am being completely ignored. i lost two valuable friends. T because i was an idiot and introduced him to N, and N because I am not enough. N was the only thing keeping me alive, and now that I have been replaced i do not have anymore value. but what if i try and fail again? what then? all I will have accomplished is making everyone around me feel like shit. i do not know what to do anymore i feel so stuck. i wish i was never even born, so many people could have lived a better life if i was not born. I am just an expendable sack of flesh and bones why should anyone care about me. i cannot believe i ever thought i was important to N. it was stupid of me really. I have never been important to anyone so why did i think he was different? even so, he is the most amazing person I have ever met and i will never forget him. i hope he knows thatidk what else to say i think I am done. anyone got something to say that might be helpful? i did not realize i could be so easily replaced",Suicidal

"So I broke up with my boyfriend, telling him I need a break. The reason being I am only 22 and hes 27 and he wants to be with me forever, he said I am the one for him. I have a disorganised attachment style. Meaning I am pulled between desperately wanting affection (anxious) to not wanting any affection at all and wanting to just end the relationship because I feel its an attack on my independence (avoidant) he said he loves me and will wait for me. I said I will only need a few weeks or a month or something to get myself together. I just feel locked in, like I am so young and will be with this person forever. Hes perfect for me. When I was feeling suicidal once he took 2 days off work to be with me to make sure I am okay. Hes a good communicator, he cares and loves me. there is no drama as I am used to in other relationships. So anyway, the night I broke up with him I got insanely drunk and ended up going to a former FWB house and had sex with him. I also messaged one of my co workers for sex.. so embarrassing because hes the type that will tell EVERYONE at work and make me look like a desperate slag. Then the next day I had to work, despite being super hung over. Like not in the sick way, just my whole body could not stop shaking. Whenever I tried to serve a customer id shake uncontrollably and had to go out the back and I ended up crying. Anyway to sum it all up, I am embarrassed, like I need to quit my job right now because I never want to face any of them again and feel like my coworkers probably think I am crazy and stupid. Although they do know the reason I was acting that way. But now all I want to do is die. I have slept for almost 24 hours, the most I have ever slept in my life. I woke up a few times but could not bear putting up with the thoughts so I went back to sleep. I feel like I have made a big mistake. I have screwed up being with a guy that is perfect for me, just because of my need for independence and wanting to sleep around.. like how ridiculous and selfish. My life is a mess. I have no friends and no one that cares. All I want to do is take a bottle of pills and die. Please help. I broke up with my boyfriend 2 days ago, now I feel so suicidal. Please help.",Suicidal
"[IWTL how to lose weight]( yesterday, I posted this on the IWTL sub, and today I took the peoples advice from the sub and started my weight loss journey. I did some exercises for today and after I was done, I sat down with a healthy breakfast. As soon as I sat in front of the tv to eat, my mom taunted me, So you started exercising today? I said, Yeah. She suddenly told all my family that I(me) was not going to eat any butter or pasta or any junk food. I did not respond at all because I am used to her being that way and you cannot really reason with unreasonable people. Then she proceeded to say that she will order pasta and some noodles and was staring at my face. My mom has been my first bully and has never understood me and so has the rest of my family. I love the foods she mentioned and she knows that I am insecure about myself and I will have to resist myself a great deal if she orders that. My little sister (18) chimed in and added to all this. She said she would also order things for her to eat. All the junk food imaginable. And all of them waited to see how did I react. I did not react and pretended like this did not happen. This is a pattern now, every time I try to improve they react very very negatively, I feel like shit at my house. I do not know what to do.

"I will try to make this as short as possible. I have always had problems with finding something that I like and doing it in excess, not just drugs/alcohol (even good things.) I am 25 years old I did not drink until I got to college and I liked it, but did not love it. While living on campus (you of I) I drank often but I would not say more than any other college kid. Cocaine was another story. It came around a few times and i was quickly doing it A LOT., every night type of a lot. I was able to stop that on my own somehow. Alcoholism runs in my family, although never effected my parents because they were careful. About 5 months ago I started drinking and it very quickly got out of hand. Like almost a fifth a night out of hand. Its leading to issues that have started to get worrisome. I own a lot of guns and I have started becoming somewhat suicidal. Its like alcohol woke something in me. I have always been on anti depressants. I have not seen the girl I have dated for the last 6 years in a month and she basically hates me now. I do not want clinical help, I want to tackle this like I always have for everything else. Does anybody have advice on how they fixed this on their own?

"Hi all, I went through a really bad bout of depression last year (about 6-9 months) I cannot overly remember it as it feels like a big blur. I would just be holed up in my room after I got home from work and would lay in bed for hours, not eating, just scrolling through my phone. I was living with two people at the time who I considered my best mates (they were aware of my struggles with depression - I was quite open about it with them) but this was the worst it is ever been around them. Throughout those months they moved on with their lives - got boyfriends, promotions etc. which I am incredibly happy for them (they are extroverted and neurotypical) but they took my depression personally saying I was not making an effort with the friendship and that they felt like they were 'walking on eggshells' around me - this is a major trigger for me. I told them several times that it was not personal and it is hard to get excited over someone else's life if I cannot even get excited over my own. This caused quite a big riff in the friendship &amp; I pulled back considerably because it was also setting off major anxiety for me. Because I never wanted to experience this again I started masking my depression around everyone I know. But I have noticed that when I am alone I am spiraling worse than before - I feel like I am about to fall into a serious rut and I am trying to avoid that at all costs. Has anyone had any experiences like this? Am I actually doing myself a disservice by masking my depression? I am scared I might lose another 6-9 months of my life if I do not do something.

"I identify myself as introvert. Since I have been exposed to internet from year 2016 I have always found comfort in reading about Psychology. I am fascinated by MBTI, Big 5 Models, Jungian Typology and all the things along the lines. I have focused very much on self improvement and tried to improve my skills. I figured out atleast acting like an extrovert tends to make social life a hell lot easier. But whenever I try to do this I just do not feel like myself. I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friend/family I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self (talking about things I want) because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine.

Another thing that has really helped me is learning to enjoy the nature like when it is raining or you are going for a walk in a sunny day. I do recommend learning to ride a bike because it has helped me a lot. My friends forced me to go outside and learn riding.

My home life was never good.I have always said Ill die by 40 if I make no progress but it often feels like the earlier the better. My guilty conscience leads me to wait until my family is older. I have been struggling with burnout and usually no one notices in my family and ignores me (probably my fault since I get irritable). For reference, I am autistic (aspergers), have ADHD, anxiety and depression. The latter three since I was 6 years old. My little sister came into my room tonight and made me dinner (leftovers, she knows I do not eat regular meals. I forget or food just is not appealing.. I am very picky and she knows me by now). Pretty sure she heard me crying and saw me cry earlier today, but its making me cry more that she even noticed. Maybe she did not notice but I know she caught on as I was crying as she brought me food. I know I have my own issues, but both of my little siblings are or have been suicidal and hospitalized and I just do not want to add on any pressure to anyone in my family. My older sister has a kid and a divorce at a young age and is unstable in many ways. But I am 25 now and its breaking me feeling so alone and I cannot be perfect. I have had to put on a show since my two little sisters came into my life when I was 15 when my mom got married (which I would not ever trade it was a good thing). I got my act together but instead just have the same issues I did at age 9 at age 25 and have not progressed socially at all. I have not dated. Never been asked out. I lose friends due to being impulsive and saying the wrong things. People say I am nice but somehow all of my relationships are superficial. No one reaches out to me for actual conversation unless they need something. I realized I am starting to suffer severe burn out. Doctors notes say at age 13 I said Ill stay in my room and just not talk. I have done that since and did not even know I saw that. My memory itself it very poor. But here is the catch. How do you deal with burn out when you cannot ever express your true emotions? I always lie on impulse and say I am watching a sad movie (which is what I did today and I referenced a movie I cried to recently called Ride Your Wave). I do not think I can be vulnerable. Therapy and medicine has not helped this because I am too stubborn to open my mouth and say more that the bare minimum. I either lie or get so angry if I have to express the truth, so I never express the truth. The anger is really me just being overwhelmed and I know that others cannot take that well and resent me for it. I was chastised far too often and hit too often as a kid for my fits. To be fair, I hit too. My parents never cared for positive reinforcement or bothered learning how to soothe a mentally ill child. My mother never listened to my doctors when they said she should try complimenting me for once (they legit said this as she was negative in my doctor appointments).How can I be vulnerable when no one ever took me serious enough when I struggled the most and it came off as anger? I got tossed aside so my little sisters could get the help they needed since I got good grades. My own stubbornness makes it so no one wants to help me or ask how I am or how I feel. I just answer I am fine. Its stifling. I never meant to push anyone away but why does no one ask me how I am or press further? It hurts. Sometimes I hate living with these conditions and nights like tonight when my little sister came into my room give me some hope. I am not completely hopeless, but 10 (25) years of working my ass off to feel like I have not gotten anywhere socially and I still cannot cook well and cannot get out of my room. People say to just try/do it. I try it and fail I get overwhelmed and cannot do it again. I am trying hard and they know I am behind but it seems I can only help myself but I just have not been able to. I know at this point I need to do things alone but how do I start? Not to mention there is no new psychiatrist available until October. Online ones exist but cannot prescribe the stimulant I take. I am just stuck. Thanks for reading. I am just not sure Ill be here when I am middle age if I do not progress or even a year. Being behind is hard and people make fun of you if you are a picky eater or are a creature of habit but I cannot help it. Why cannot people be more understanding. Why cannot I understand myself. Its a two way compromise but I am so stubborn I get nowhere. How much longer?",Suicidal
"Today I had a good day, I quit my toxic job and received 4 calls for better jobs apart from that I sold things that I tried to sell for 2 years and made contact with old friends it was a very productive and good day / week but I do not feel like that, always at the end of the day I have a feeling that everything I do is wrong, that it must have been better if it had not been me, as if I were evil, bug, something that should not exist, which every night goes to the same thought ..... should I still be alive?(If what I feel or post does not go on this subreddit sorry in some way I think I had to remove it but I do not want to bother anyone, sorry) Today had a good day but not feel like these",Depression

"I will not lie, I put on a good poker face so that when people look at me it seems like my life is sunshine and rainbows. Hell, I have even had people tell me that it seems like I live a fun life. I am young, fit, pretty successful for my age, and not an ugly looking person. Underneath all of this, there is an insecure little boy that suffered from sexual assault as a child, severe bullying, had an eating disorder for 8 years, has mentally abusive parents/has been in toxic relationships, and has panic/anxiety attacks every night. I do not actually have any close friends despite having people that want to be friends with me. When I try to talk to people, it does not feel genuine or they have this expectation of me based on my image that does not reflect who I am as a person. Its exhausting that people think I am a huge ball of fun energy and loves to party, that is not who I am at all. And when they find out how I actually am as a person, it sucks because I literally see them lose interest in me. My family raised me and distilled values of perfectionism and reputation to the point that they stripped me of any bit of originality. When I try to be myself around them, I get told I am being weird or what will people think about you. My own mother calls me ugly and points out the smallest imperfectionsI go on dates and people just want to have sex with me for my body, and when I want to develop an emotional connection I get blown off - often times because the other side did not expect me to be as emotional as I am and it scares them. I feel like I have no one to be vulnerable with and it makes me feel so unbelievably lonely. The thing is, I do not think I have ever felt like I was not lonely. Who am I living for? What am I even working so hard for? How did I even get this far? On the outside everything looks perfect",Suicidal
"I put this together while sobbing so hard I almost made myself vomit last night. I had a pounding headache, had to hold my breath so my parents would not hear me crying.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years. I have never hd a girlfriend before and I am 25. The pain from never being able to be with her has contributed to my decision to kill myself; I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.It reads.Dear K,I wish you knew how special you are to me. I wish you knew you how happy I would be if we were together. But I know that would not make you happy. So, I have to let you be happy. That is what I want, because I love you so much.I wish you knew how happy you make me. I wish you knew how full of love my heart is for you. I wish I could hold you in my arms and protect you so that no one could hurt you.When I was young, I learned the word for always in French: *toujours.* It always sounded like a beautiful, graceful, yet heavy word to me. Something about how it sounds. It sounds melancholy, sentimental, but genuine and strong.you will always be in my heart. Toujours. Always. you will always be in my heart. I promise.I love you so much. I have written a few suicide notes I am going to send to a few different people when I do it. This one is going to the girl I am in love with.",Depression

I would literally give anything to be able to quit. I was 16 the last time I attempted suicide and I am honestly getting really strong suicidal thoughts now, I feel so trapped and helpless and alone.

"I cannot live with my anxiety anymore, I cannot handle it.. not in a life like this, I just hope if there is something after this life it will be more kind to me then this life was, everything I have had to go through in my life has lead to nothing but more suffering, more pain. it is a cruel fucking random game life is. I do not see any reason to live anymore, nobody In my house listens to me, I guess talking to me about literally fucking ANYTHING is the most difficult thing ever, every. GOD DAMN. THING. yet they can criticize me however they want, I am lazy, I am Ignorant, I am negative, I am crazy.. fucking assholes. some people were not meant to be fucking parents, I will tell you that right now.. sharing anything with them is like talking to a god damn brick wall, my entire life you have just yelled at me and never pushed me to do anything out of my comfort zone. Now because of that I am, just useless... that is all I will ever be,I do not have any friends either, nobody who gives a fuck enough to listen to me anyways, which Is fine. I do not expect anyone to be friends with a mentally ill depressed awkward fucking retard tbh, if I was in their shoes I would probably do the same, so no hard feelings there :) part of me feels bad for doing this now considering what just happened in my mom's family 4 days ago.. I wish I could push myself to stay a little longer and did not have to put her through losing someone else, but I do not think I would be able to help her anyway.. I feel like putting her through this now instead of later when she just started healing would be less-cruel, but I do not know.. I just hope my dad will be able to help her through this, but I cannot continue, I do not want to continue.. I do not want to waste so much pointless fucking energy just to grow old and die alone, I do not want to continue living In a fucking awful home filled with people who do not even acknowledge me, I do not want to continue being alone while everyone around me has some connection to something or someone... so, I am done.

I have just been going about my life the last few years but I am starting to get really depressed. I do not want to be alone like this 20-30 year's from now, and it seems like now that I am out of school and working it is even harder to meet people. The only time I meet new people is at work. I know I obviously need to make friends, but how? I play my guitar, go fishing, cook, and I also like to read. I know what I need to do i just do not know how to do it...like how does somebody who has zero friends just starting making them? And how can I start getting in the dating scene?

"I do not know where to begin. It feels like there is too much to say, and it all feels complicated. I do not understand myself first off, so it will be hard to explain my feelings to those reading this. I cannot exactly identify my feelings a lot of times. I used to feel true joy, the kind of joy where I felt alive and vibrant. I think I lost this kind of joy in about 8th grade or freshman year of high school. I now am graduating as a senior, and I still feel the same way. Its not like I am necessarily sad. I can feel ok, but i will never feel like the funny girl who could make someone light up from my jokes and personality like back then. I can never feel completely alive. I can never feel completely like myself. I guess along with this, its like I never feel truly happy? I am confused on when I feel happy or not. To be honest, maybe I am never completely happy. Its confusing. I would say actually that I do feel happiness, but its artificial. Its still really cool in those moments when I feel that type of happiness, but it just is not enough? Its like I cannot feel the same with people as I used to. I cannot bond with people the same. Its like I feel robotic almost in conversation? Not much emotion is there lol. I would say that with sadness, perhaps there is always a gloomy disposition lingering in the back of my mind. Maybe for so long, its so hard to identify it. For so long, I have also felt bouts of anxiousness. Even now maybe anxiety is apart of me and its lingering in the depths of my mind I cannot reach out towards because I can barely even identify it. At this point in my life I am just scared Ill be like this for a very long time, I simply do not know if I would want to exist if I knew Id be like this for the rest of my life. I already feel doubt in life, but its because I am so young and just getting into the world and discovering it that I have hope, hope that Ill change and that Ill go on to do great things and experience great things. I am so worried though, I am worried of different things at different periods of my life. It seems like I have new anxieties here and there while simultaneously feeling a sense of uneasiness always inhabiting the back of my mind I guess. I am just not me anymore. Life looks grey I guess. I guess its looked like that for so long that I feel odd even bringing it up, like perhaps its just not true because this has been my normal for so long. Sometimes I feel like I need mental help but then feel stupid because I feel as though maybe there is nothing much wrong with me, but what makes me realize truly that there is probably something wrong with me is the thought of staying like this forever. It makes me not want to exist anymore, and whenever I come to that realization, I immediately know something is not right. I remember whenever I was talking to a nurse about how I felt, but its as though she brushed it off as simply being my personality. It felt wrong, and I hope its wrong. I really hope I will not stay like this forever, and that its not just my personality. It does not feel like that. It should not be like that, you know? I think I should add that I was on Prozac since the end of my freshman year until I think the summer before my senior year btw! Maybe that will help (: But I came here because I really would love to hear some advice overall. What am I experiencing and how do I even get out of this mess? How do I feel alive again?

"(23 M) I come to this sub every now and then for something to relate to, to hear about people who seem to be experiencing life the way I am. It does not matter what life events are occurring, good or bad, people of all ages are impacted by depressive thoughts and ultimately suicidal ideation. I really do not know if I could ever do it. I think about it all the time, even while enjoying the time I spend alive. Recently more than ever it just seems like a real possibility, something to almost look forward too. I cannot think about it without thinking about the people who know me and love me, the problems it may because for them is the main reason I do not do it. When I think about it I also think about the larger picture, the reality of this situation. I understand that even in our darkest moments, tormented by our thoughts and clinging to life by whatever threads we have left, we still do things like this, like reaching out on this sub. As small as this action is, its so powerful. Everyone reaching out and opening up on this thread is so powerful, so desperate to live. Even when all hope is seemingly lost, we compile our thoughts and essentially throw a lifeline in an attempt to save our own lives. Think about how amazing that is, even if we feel so unloved, so hopeless, so lost, ashamed, abandoned, dreadful, or sorry, we still reach out in order to save our own lives. We reach out to beautiful strangers on this app to assist us in this journey of life, to give us just something, anything to survive, or at least make it easier to live a little longer. We are our own friends, we are the people who unconditionally love ourselves, we are programmed to keep fighting, typing a message and sending it on this sub is a huge testament to our strength as humans. You may want to die, but in the most sincere and loving way I can possibly say this, you reach out here, you read these messages because you simply want to live. I hope that no matter what you choose to do in your life you realize the power you have over yourself and your ability to change your own world. You are your own beautiful lifeline, whether you realize that or not. Here I am again",Suicidal

The girl I met in high school and then become lovers died after 4 years of dating after high school, family is also non existant, had health issues etc.I was pretty okay with many stuff starting the life without a lack of family, having hard time to find my place in the social life and such and always felt strong enough to deal with everything but as the time goes I just got tired of being strong, acting strong, trying to implement myself in to social life and finding people to bond with have a good time with.And recently by losing the last person I felt some connection to the world being gone and myself having some health issues that may or may not be important, having to lose all my friends and now that not being able to find new people and such, I just got really tired, really tired, I carried so much stuff as a child and a grown up but somehow I am now exhausted I never thought I will be this tired in life like ever.I always been a observer but I am tired of being one because I cannot fit myself in to anything nowadays and I am tired of seeing people being happy with something/someone I started to get jealous and question my life and found the details I ignored all this time.That questioning part lead me to asking; Did I really deserved everything? Because should not that be go like, bad things happen then you get some happiness and then it gets a straight line for normal and always climbs up for people who are extremely lucky. (I know there is no rule this is just a random vent I guess?)I concluded on that I do not deserve to be alive and I do not fit in anywhere in life anymore. So therefore I believe that I should just give up at this point because I had enough, I tried enough, I fought enough.Funny part is I still love life, how things go for people around me as I said I spent so much time observing them and I like how good things going for them etc. I am just tired of mine going flat down with everything, literally everything.I kind of do not expect anything from anyone and I still have like a pages of things that I can talk about and the saddest part is I am aware of literally everything; my situation, what should I do, how I sound etc.Anyways this is the chaos going on in my head that I plan to solve by giving up,Thank you.

"Kind of hard to explain in full detail, but I kind of always thought I was a worthless piece of shit but also thought ""hey I am kind of better than other people at this one thing"" which was useful as a job so I figured I would just tough life out so my parents would not be sad and all that stuff. But recently I realized that no, actually, you are not very good at your job, you should have been fired years ago, you cannot get a new job, and you are too useless to do anything else. So my options are essentially to leech off my parents for my whole life or be homeless. Or, possibly, constantly get hired on for low wage menial work and be fired within a few weeks for sucking. I choose option 4 as I do not see any value in life anyway. My desire to not have my parents be sad is no longer strong enough to keep me here. Too bad for them that they took the chance and had a child. I am only partially delaying as the method I have chosen could be dangerous to people so I am trying to figure out how to avoid anyone getting hurt. It should be quick and relatively painless though. I just need a very empty space or something to counteract the toxicity after I perish. Of course I would prefer to have nembutal but getting your hands on it is such a hassle and it is hard to be sure you are actually getting nembutal if you try to get it from seedy sources.

I am so tired of depression. One of the worst feelings i have lately is knowing if i did not feel this way so often i would be so much better of a person. I notice how much it holds me back and i always just picture would i could do and what i would be capable of if i did not feel this way all the time.

"Hey you all.I am a 38 year old male, married with an 8 year old and a 8 month old. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for around 20 years now. I was passively suicidal about 3-4 years ago, but that feeling has since dropped of dramatically with proper medication, therapy, and leaving a life situation behind that I really struggled with.What I am really struggling with feeling alone and without people that care lately, outside of my own four walls.Growing up, I had a very close family on my mom's side. I have 2 brothers, 4 aunt's/uncle's and many cousins from those. We used to get together every Sunday and all major holidays.My mom passed away back in 2008 and nothing family had been the same since, especially for me. My mom was amazing - she was my biggest cheerleader, my confidant, and talked me off every ledge. After she died, My dad moved about 14 hours away. One of my brothers is estranged because of an incredibly dumb situation that he completely cut me off since about 6 years ago. I have tried multiple times to mend that fence, to no avail. I just get ignored. Since then two of my mom's siblings have also passed, and one moved across the country. My other cousins have either stopped talking to me because of my brother situation or moved away, or I am quite a bit younger so we never really got together much.I have also heard that quite a few of them think I am snobby, because I am one of the only members of my family to graduate from college and I make great money. I NEVER shove that in anyone's face though, and I do not want any of that to define me. The only two members of my family I have really even seen outside of weddings or funerals is my other brother and my dad. As previously mentioned, my dad is not around and my other brother is my best friend, and we are super close. About a month ago though, he decided to up and move south with his family because he could no longer afford to live in MA. Obviously I support him and want what is best for HIS life, but I was devastated.On the friends front, I have never been great at having close friends. I had a really close friend growing up but over the years we have drifted apart. I have a decent group of college friends, but none that I see or hang out with often - except one - and about 5-6 years ago he moved across the country to be with the love of his life. I am so incredibly happy for the guy but at the same time, I felt such a huge loss. I am honestly not that great of a friend anyway. When I go through depressive episodes, I tend to flake a lot.I do have a spiritual community, but I am not particularly friendly with any of them. I am also much younger than about 90% of the congregation. Tldr - I guess what is bothering me most is feelings of abandonment. I do not want to be close with people because everyone I have cared about has either left me, cut me out of their lives, or died. I am really struggling with relationships, and the thing most depressing me right now is if I happened to die - whether self inflicted or not - who would even show up to my funeral? I do not feel like there is anyone out there that gives a flying shit what happens to me beyond my wife and my girls, and that really sucks. I just want to feel important and cared for, and I do not feel like I have any of that. I feel like my wake would be about 20 people and none of them would even give a shit about actually wanting to me there, and that makes me sad. Feeling incredibly lonely lately",Depression
"I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I do not have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities did not believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I am their abuser and they are my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I am being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it is killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently cannot go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof. Abused as a child",Suicidal

"So to me that means that being depressed means I am pressed down I side myself, because the environment is not safe for me. Sometimes small changes make the environment safe- different dress, behaving certain ways, etc. But it is more interesting to me how I can change my environment by changing parts of me that I am ok with changing. I do not want to change parts of myself, my personality, values and characteristics. I like and respect these parts of me that remember reality and events and protect me. But I am willing to change parts of myself like, the actions I take to connect with people. The actions I take to be more ""pushed our"" into the world, environments where it is safe for me to be seen exactly as I truly am.

Maybe alcohol would be the better way to go, just get like fifty beers or something maybe a hundred. How bout them other drugs? Not that I have access to them, but that would be nice. I know it is not funny to joke about this kind of stuff, if I did not fear death or the possibility of there being an afterlife, I would be gone in a flash. Well I guess I am slowly killing myself by smoking, so maybe I should stop that. Not that I want to, but I do not want some higher power being like ""hmm, you smoked them cigarettes being fully aware what they do to you? Okay time to send another form of your consciousness to an even worse place MWHAHAHAHA"" Not calling it God, the abrahamic deity called God is so fucking childish, if there was really a creator or high power of some sort, it would not be some dude that said humans were in the image of him, getting angry and jealous, and having three different forms yet saying they are all one. Maybe there is no creator or higher power and the pre-existent bigbang has always existed. I do not know dudes, but I am sick of living, but I do not want to kill myself then become something else within the universe or reality and have dark energy push ""me"" into an even worse place(or I do not know how dark matter dark energy works but something like that) I feel like I am cursed to suffer for all of eternity already. we are already in hell dudes, is it possible to climb the ladder and find the kingdom of heaven from within, I have no idea, but I guess I will try again. Maybe some meditation or something will help me, this world so fucked up yo. How could I possibly know I have not been existent an infinite amount of times? Can you try to think back to what you/it were like before you were born? You cannot, or at least I cannot. Maybe this is really the first time for existence to occur, but there are theories for infinite universes so I do not know. If the universe is possible, then I guess anything is possible. Maybe I am the only one that exists and all of you and everything else is an illusion with my brain and senses acting as filters and playing tricks on me, or maybe I am part of that illusion as well. who is fucking dream is this world? Or is this dream/illusion just self reliant on its own with no one or thing to dream it. An illusion implies that there is an opposite of that like a factuality or actuality or something idk. I am fearful of the unknown, and I do not know anything. I do not have the courage to go through with it. I guess I am not starving in a third world country or enslaved in human trafficking so it could be worse I suppose, I am a whiny kid with a smartphone acting like a little bitch, but I do have my own problems I will not lie.

"I met my ex-wife when I was 19 and after 3 months she insisted that we get married. Obvious red flag, and I knew that then, but I had extremely low self esteem and thought it was a miracle that anybody would be interested in me in the first place.I thought that if I said no, Id lose her and be alone the rest of my life so I agreed. Thus began one of the worst chapters of my life.To keep a long story short(ish), naive sheltered me ended up introduced to hard drugs, got my shit kicked in by a meth head trying to rape my wife, watched her nearly die due to OD, wandered several states homeless, and got constantly reminded that she did not love me, but just married me to get away from her insane mom.She ended up pregnant and a few months after our daughter was born, she told me she did not need anything from me anymore and filed for divorce. She wanted me to just agree to disappearing from my daughters life, but there was no way in hell I could do that, especially since my own father disappeared shortly after I was born, so I fought it.Me disobeying her made her furious, so during the divorce/custody hearings she accused me of everything under the sun, saying I was physically/sexually abusive, a pedophile, that I trafficked her, etc. etc. She had nothing to support any of those claims because they were bullshit, but I was investigated by DHS and law enforcement three times, because she just kept making worse and worse accusations.In the end, she got full custody because the judge said every child should be with the mother not the father (were in a deep red state), and I got standard visitation. The next several years were their own nightmare that I will not get into because this is getting too long, but she constantly tried to poison my daughter against me and my family and was generally extremely toxic. Luckily, my daughter is smart and saw through the lies.Her mom re-married, had another daughter, then around the time my daughter was 8, she decided she did not want to be a mom anymore and just left to who-knows-where.My daughter moved in with me and we heard almost nothing about her mom until my daughter was 12 when we found out she hung herself.I have never cried so hard in my life, not for myself, but for empathy for my daughter. I have to watch as my daughter now has occasional panic attacks, I have to listen as she occasionally weeps in the other room, and I have to feel guilty as a small hateful part of me is glad that her mom is gone and cannot spread anymore poison.

I push through each day hoping something will change.When does it get better?When will there be someone that is there for me and not because they feel bad? I am about to finish up my internship and feel worse. People say they are proud of me and it makes me cringe because I do not deserve it. I have been a failure all my life why would it change now?My birthday was during the internship and nobody noticed... and for some reason that brought me joy knowing that nobody noticed me. That maybe if I disappear nobody would notice I walked on this earth. it is weird that this brings me joy... Where is my mind?,Depression

"Just had one of the most fun weekend in years. Went out, hung out with friends, ended up separating from my friends and hung out with 3 strangers and explored the town for hours. Legitimately one of the most fun nights I have had in a longggg time. Literally was hanging out with these people and talking like we have been friends forever. Then it just ended. We went our separate ways and life went back to normal on Monday when I had work. I cannot stop thinking about how fun this weekend was but its also making me insanely depressed and sad. WHY? Like I just experienced something that brought me so much goddamn joy and happiness and its like my brain thinks I did not deserve it or that Ill never experience it again. Idk if this even make sense but fuck. It feels like I lost friends that I have known for a lifetime. What is wrong with me ? I knew them for 4 hours hahah Why do I get SO sad after fun days?

"I started to have this feeling just last March this year, this is new to me so I am not even sure if I am already considered as having suicidal ideation.

"My sibling is trans (17, pre-op, ftm, he/them). Our parents are good parents, some bumps here and there. they are opposed to my sibling transition. I support my sibling, but I am not very good with words and kind of a coward. I have a hard time standing up to our dad about it. Our dad is a good man, but he is a butt sometimes. he is so supportive with both of us wanting to pursue artistic careers, teaching us how to be more independent, and will never abandon his us. he is firm about keeping us all together (since he is distanced himself from certain distant family). he is talked us both down from trying to kill ourselves more than once. But he seems so apathetic when it comes to this. I feel guilty for not being able to properly comfort them when they get depressed about it. My sibling and I are both LGBTQ+, are bipolar, have depression, and have anxiety, so I kind of understand how it feels when Dad acts like that. Our Dad has a bisexual sister and loves her (even though she always gets into trouble), so I know he does not hate us for being LGBTQ+. he is not exactly traditional either (he wants his daughters to be independent), so why cannot he be more supportive? I think it is the ""transition"" part he does not like. Maybe he is scared that my sibling will hate that body as well, if not worse. I understand the sentiment, but my sibling is dead set on developing a masculine body. I want to pay for it myself, but cannot. (I am 19, not a guardian, and broke). What can I do to comfort my sibling? Any good advice or thoughts? How do I comfort my trans sibling?",Suicidal
"If I did not live with my dad, I would feel better about offing myself. The only reason why I have not attempted yet is because I do not want him to find me before I die. I do not want to risk being severely brain damaged. I wish I lived alone, so it would be easier to hang myself.",Suicidal

"New to posting here. On mobile so sorry for mistakes.I have (21F) been struggling with depression for about 5-6 years now but I have not gotten an official diagnosis yet. I do not think my parents want to admit I have it but I know I do.I did not used to feel this way. I was a happy teen for the majority of it. Things only really started to decline when I was 16. I have had ups and downs but its remained pretty consistent. However its been getting worse and worse since 2019. Even before all this covid crap.I have a nice life. I have a loving family and two wonderful parents that I love very much and who love me very much. I have some pretty great siblings too. I have a wonderful and amazing boyfriend that I met online last year and who is going to come visit me in September (unfortunately its a long distance relationship). I have a great best friend who I also met online and that I love very much. I have a good job (it does not pay enough at all and its incredibly boring but the family I work for is wonderful and is the only reason I have stayed with it for 3 years). I should be happy. I have so many wonderful blessings. But I am not.I have only felt worse and worse with each passing month. The depressive episodes are only getting longer and harder to crawl out of. I never want to do anything I like to do anymore. I cannot get excited about things that usually make me happy anymore. I keep having awful nightmares about feeling trapped, cornered, and helpless but everyone around me says Ill be just fine.I know I am loved. I know I am worthy of love. But I just feel so tired and lonely and empty. I am so sick of life.Sorry for the rant. I just feel really bad tonight and I had to vent because no one else is online or around to talk to.

Diabetes can be a real pain but is on whole quite manageable with the grin and bare it mentality I have developed. It took me 7 or so years to graduate university with a degree in biology, I second guessed my self so often it was easier to go to bed than accomplish anything worthwhile. Relationships are taxing when I cannot numb my mind, I process and realize outcomes quicker than they can become reality. Tonight I went to play trivia with friends as is usual. All of them bailed last minute but being the extrovert I am I was able to join a new group and had a bunch of fun with them. A person I would consider a crush was there tonight and after trivia I attempted to communicate with them. They ghosted me which was very unlike our previous interactions.

"There is nothing in my life that i wish more than death yet i am still afraid of doing the thing. I am such a coward, i cannot live a life but i cannot even die, what the hell am i doing here?

But i are not no American and the only way i have to take my life is through something painful or that does not grant instant death. Should i hang myself if i cannot achieve a full suspension? Hell no, low suspension method is too risky, takes too much time and there is always a chance for an ""hero"" to appear... Imagine living a life with a brain that is so rotten it does not allow you to wipe your ass, It would be surprisingly worse than before. Then should i just jump from height?

What other choices do i have left? I do not know, i am not very smart and i cannot think of a painlessly way to die on my own but if you try to search on the internet for a way to do it, you will only get suicide hotlines numbers and related stuff.Everything related to suicide is literally censored. We basically have no right to die in this sick, cruel world to the extent that we are forced to stay here, just waiting for the death to come. That is sick, why is that so?

I am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes, have a loving family, friends, and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.However, my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since I was a young teenager. Even in grade school, I exhibited signs of clinical depression and hints of suicidal behavior that had no obvious justification. My family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need, and I cannot ever thank them enough for that. Nonetheless, I still feel this gargantuan, intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.What I feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals, but a general dislike for being human. No matter how I weigh the quantifiable joy I have experienced in my life, it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. I perhaps feel so terrible that I feel nothing at all.On a primal level, I possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. I hate being human. I do not want to be me anymore. Why do I have to be me? The sheer pain I feel is indescribable, and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that I can extract from life. Even if all of my earthly desires were satisfied this instant, I would feel nothing but the phantom pain.

I really do not know where to ask this so I am asking here, if I missed something in the rules and its not allowed here please tell me! Ok so I am 13F. I was friends with this girl a couple years ago before we moved. Recently her family moved in with us temporarily until they can get on their feet, get a house and such. So its their mom, my old friend (11F), and her brother (9M). I am not really friends with her anymore, and am now more friends with her brother. Since we have become friends I have realized he is most likely depressed (though he has not been diagnosed) and has been occasionally harming himself. Not cutting, but scratching himself with his nails or sharp objects, but that does not make it any less worrying. I am also depressed, (I have been diagnosed, so my parent are aware) and have self harmed (still kind of am). that is one of the reason we became friends, because we could bond over our feelings and opinions. We have a group chat with his sister and had kind of vented there. She got worried apparently and showed our moms. They got really mad at us for talking about that sort of thing. Said it was inappropriate and we should have come to them if we were feeling like that. And his mom said if they were sad, depressed, or self harming that they would be sent to a mental hospital and would not be able to see her for months. No talk about the severity just in general, if they were or were doing any of those things that they would have to go to one.. We ended up getting grounded from our devices because of it. I know her saying that made my friend really anxious and uncomfortable talking about going to somewhere like that.Since then I have heard her say that and things similar to that (some in more detail) to my friend and his sister. I know it always makes him uncomfortable and upset. Idk would she be considered toxic or is she justified in saying stuff like that? (Sorry for the long explanation) Do you guys think my friends mom is being toxic?",Depression
No one cares. My audience does not. I would kill myself and they would all celebrate because of how stupid I am. Too stupid to liveNo on will ever care anyway I will just suffer in silence I guess,Depression
I love sleep it is like a teaser trailer for death. I use to escape with drugs which I enjoyed alot but these days I cannot really enjoy them because I am older and my body is in shit condition and it irritates my system. Gaming barely works as a escape I really wish we had more advance VR these days that was indistinguishable from real life but that is at least a decade away or more. I do not know about you guys but sleep is pretty much my last great place I can escape from my shitty reality. Sleep the last great escape,Depression

"This may be long, so I apologize. I am 29/F, married and a mother. Let me begin by stating my husband is about as supportive as he can be and my child is incredibly understanding. All this aside, my depression and manic episodes are beginning to get out of control. And I honestly, do not even know where to begin and truthfully my story is not one really worth sharing. I feel as though this deserves a disclaimer that I do not feel right sharing my sorrows as I see myself being more fortunate than others. But I am so lost that I feel this need to post something, rather than continue hovering over this sub and other subs related to mental health, depression and anxiety. Currently, I am on 20mg of Lexapro and 600- 900mg of Gabapentin per day. My father was an alcoholic, and my mentally ill mother suffers from bipolar disorder, depression and classic narcissism. I was raised in an extremely religious family in the Bible-belt of USA. My entire life up until 16 was immersed in the Southern Baptist culture. My parents divorced when I was 4, and I did not see my father for 17 years. During my upbringing, my mother and father managed to marry 6 people between the two of them. Somehow during the later years, my fathers 3rd wife managed to get him sober. We reconnected when I was 20 years old and 9 months pregnant. I suffered for years from mental and physical abuse by the hands of my mother and her 3 husbands between ages 4-18. Needless to say, my life centered around their instability. I was the oldest, and therefore inherently responsible for my younger siblings. Being in a violent home, the anxiety I suffered was not acknowledged. I was the girl in school that everyone knew had a rough home. My friends were my escape and still today remain my chosen family. But the fact of the matter is, they do not truly understand my situation. I gravitate towards people who are not nearly as jaded. I leaned on my friends parents for guidance and empathy. I have always been the black sheep of my mothers family. I am creative, incredibly artistic, intelligent, charismatic and I am not sorry about it. However, my family views me as strange and always have. I was always told how much I looked and naturally acted like my dad, someone they hated my entire life. I have absolutely nothing in common with my mother or her side of the family, and frankly, I am extremely resentful. We rarely speak unless its a holiday. I refuse to have my child around their toxicity. My mother is on her 4th husband, and just as manic as ever. My father, who I had so much in common with, died from alcoholism in 2017. After years of sobriety, he lost his film business and drowned his sorrows tenfold. His death was gruesome. He died alone in an old farmhouse, during the August heat in North Carolina. His body rotted for 9 days before anyone found him. I can still smell him today. His death destroyed me. After years of separation from my father due to his substance abuse, I was so happy to have him back in my life. But he suffered from his own mental health issues and lost himself. I miss him every damn day. Fast forward to now. My husband and I have been together since 2008. Our child is 8 years old. I promised myself that I would NOT repeat the cycles of instability and abuse with my own child. I am proud to say I have kept that promise. My husband and I have always put our kid first, including making the decision just to have the one child in an effort to provide the best life. we have done it all. We bought a house in the suburbs of a great small town, we are part of the community, provide a great education, we are not religious, and we make sure that our child has an active lifestyle both in and out of school. We both work full time and I am a part time college student. Our vehicles are paid off and our debts are very minimal. Life is great, right? Here is where my own mental health issues come to light. I suffer from clinical depression and panic disorder. I see a physician regularly and have been on my own medication for a little over a year. My job is incredibly stagnant and in such a toxic environment. Every day I dread this job. I have been there 5 years. Now that I am educated, and have consistent years in a particular industry, I feel confident moving onto a better paying position and hopefully a better workplace. I have been job hunting for four months. The job market is terrible and the competition could not be higher. I have never been so rejected in my life. My car is beginning to fall apart and I cannot afford to fix it, or purchase a new one. My studies can be overwhelming at times and my professors this summer in particular have been hard on us. I have a number of hobbies, including a podcast and I am so lost. My depression is so out of control. I have no family support whatsoever, and I feel like I already lean so much on my husband. I am scared to lean more for our marriage will break. I write this because I am scared my kid is beginning to notice. There are days where I can barely get out of bed, unless it is for work. I wish so badly that I had my dad to call. He had his issues, but he got me. I feel like antidepressants only help me so much. Some days I just sit in my car and think, ""I could just smash this into a concrete wall and it would be over."" I feel like I am a rat in a cage getting nowhere. I have been going through recruiting hell trying to find a new job. I have had many phone interviews, several in person interviews and I am either over qualified, or qualified except one detail they are looking for. I cannot win for losing. Perhaps this is more of a venting post. Am I alone in this? I have always done a great job of putting my own issues on the back burner, pushing through the pain and laughing to keep from crying. But these last 2 months have made me realize that perhaps that was not the best avenue. This is the first time in my life that I cannot escape my depression and my manic episodes. Intrusive thoughts are ever present and beginning to worsen everyday. I cannot brush them off and feel so out of control. I just want to run away. Feeling out of control.",Depression

"I put in my notice last week at the place I was working at. My last day was supposed to be Friday, but they let me go today. I was a temp so there is nothing I can do or say. I was leaving because they had told me things would change and nothing did in the two and a half months I was there.I have another job lined up. I start on Monday. But I had financially planned on working 40 hours this week. I came back from a medical leave last week. I just feel like shit. I am worried things will not work out at the place I am going to. What if there are more lies there! What if my new manager ends up hating me? What if its really stressful there as well? I had applied to a lot of jobs and did quite a few interviews. This new place is not bad, but its not what I really wanted. There was one company I so wanted to work for, but they turned me down last Monday. I am still sad about that for some reason.I hate how I am. Too intelligent to enjoy dumb things, but not smart enough to hang with intellectuals. Too mentally ill to keep a job long term and have a career, but not mentally ill enough to get on SSI or even get into a comprehensive therapy program. Its like I am never right. No matter how hard I try, my life always feels like its one mistake away from crumbling. I just want to stop being so damn sad. Left and Leaving",Depression
My parents admitted me to a hospital because they assumed I was going through a nervous breakdown. I had to stay there for a week and it was hell. My stay at the hospital triggered a psychotic episode. They would pin me down and give me an injection in my buttcheek. They saw me naked and they were also physically aggressive. The body language of the male staff was very threatening and triggered a lot of paranoia in me. They also gave me so many pills. I feel like my brain has become mush now. I genuinely do not want to live anymore I lost any positive trait I had left. I have been crying non stop now. I feel like I am doomed for eternity and there is nothing left for me in this world. I feel like the only good trait I had was my intelligence but now it is gone due to all the drugs I was given. I have not even graduated high school yet My stay at a hospital made me worse,Depression

Every single one of you that includes my friends family and even my colleagues have supported me endlessly and for that i am eternally grateful. This is something I have given alot of thought and still i think it is not the correct thing to do however in this current moment i cannot stand myself and every attempt to fix the way i think has failed and the only person who knows me well enough to help is being negatively impacted while trying to help.for that reason i have decided that living is simply not viable for me as i can not see an end to the pain and as long as this continues the people i love and cherrish will suffer. Yes, it is a selfish thing to do and i am not attempting to deny that fact but the only reasons i can give relate only to others as i no longer value myself. Putting this here",Suicidal
"do not really know where to start so I am going to recount my life a bit. I am a moderately healthy 16-year-old, who started high school last year. (In my country we start high school as 15-year-olds.) My family is not wealthy but we are not in any serious financial trouble. My parents are still together and I would say they raised me pretty well considering. I have an older brother and an older sister, who both moved out years ago to live their own lives but I am still really close to both of them. I love my family and my pets a lot. Right now I think they are the only reason I am still breathing.I have been anxiety ridden and suicidal for about my entire life. I had really bad separation anxiety as a kid so my mom watched over me at home. I did not go to kindergarten because of it. When school started, I used to spend an hour in the bathroom just vomiting bile every morning because of my anxiety. My stomach ached and I was trembling every morning for years. I was just too scared to go to school, because it was a new enviroment and because my teacher was in my opinion really frightning. I missed entire weeks maybe even months from school. I made plenty of friends but nothing could make me enjoy school since everyday I was just a ball of anxiety that was too afraid to do anything. At the age of seven I held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill myself just so I did not have to go to school anymore. that is how much I hated it.Obviously this was not normal behaviour for a kid so my parents put me in therapy. For years it was absolutely useless. They just made me do these weird excersises which I am starting to think was just some random busy work to keep me entertained. The only thing that helped was that they advised my parents to help me prepare for different things. For example if I had a field trip in a month to a zoo, my parents would take me and my siblings there together so I would have an easier time to go there again. This helped for a while but of course in life you cannot prepare for everything. My anxiety never went away but things became easier for a couple of years.When I was about to advance to seventh grade (13-year-old me) my anxiety was still there but thing were going well. Couple of years pass and my anxiety is going up and down in waves but the school was very understanding and complying, all my best friends were on the same class as me, I had a clear image of the future and my individual therapy was going well. Life was going really well at this point and even though I was anxious I could go to school pretty normally even though I still missed many days. At it is peak my anxiety could because me to have migraines so I had to stay home a lot. Whenever things were going bad I thought about suicide but never planned it out.On my last year before high school my anxiety just sky-rocketed and with it I became very depressed. I was not too outgoing before but now I could not even go to the store without anyone else. I did not want see or talk to any of my friends even though I really liked being with them. Before I was a staight A student but I could not even understand the words on my homework anymore. I was a perfectionist yet I did not care if I finished my assinments anymore. My grades dropped heavily. Smallest decisions became just unbearable to make. On some nights I did not eat because I could not choose what to eat even though the fridge would have been full. Some days I could not get out of bed. So many of my hobbies became untouched. I could not play games like before, I could not play he piano anymore and I could not write stories like I used to. I became entirely paralysed.My therapist was really worried about how I was feeling so they told my parents who had no idea. I was pretending to them that everything was just becoming harder in school and that I was otherwise doing just fine even though I was basically dying inside. My mother called my school and told them that she was pulling me out for 2 weeks to recover. I was basically just too overwhelmed and burned out that I was barely functioning. This was the first time I could really remember me putting a plan together to end my life. I was in so much pain. The only things I cared about doing did not bring me any joy just stress and my pride in my school succes was dwindling because I could not keep up anymore. The only reason I did not kill myself was because I did not want to die in pain and I had no idea how to kill myself without going through absolutely no pain. I have never told anyone about being suicidal anymore. Not to my family, not to my friends and not to my therapist because I am afraid of he consequences.During that time my parents prohibited me from looking at any homework, news or worry about outside life. They wanted me to recover without any possible hindurances and because of that they tried to bring me my favorite foods and give me lots of free time so I could enjoy my time playing games. I have never felt so relieved. Before that I was crying in my bed at night just dreading for the next schoolday The freedom of not having to worry about anything was amazing. At the end of those two weeks I returned to school. I was doing fine for a few days but as the school year was coming to an end I was beginning to feel a lot worse again. All that pressure from school life and my own mind had not disappeared. I had just pushed them away from my mind. I became the bitter and sad hermit who disappeared back into my room like I never left.That same old feeling of freedom returned when summer came and my school year ended. No pressure, no expectations. I did not see my friends during that entire holiday or go anywhere from my home. I was happy and safe in my room even though just outside my window I could see how wonderful the weather was outside. I could finally do the things I liked again and I could actually enjoy them this time.That did not last of course because then I went to high school to continue my studies. To my surprise the first weeks went well even though I was really anxious. Two of my best friends were still in the same school and we had lots of the same classes. I spent every moment with them and I had fun. The problems started when I could not go to any of the tests because of my anxiety. I failed a lot of courses because of it and those set backs started an unstoppable snowball-effect. My self-esteem was in the gutter and I started to hide in my room again. I slowly became me from before that two week vacation. I became more depressed again and more anxious then ever. I could not go to classes. I could not do my homework and I couln't participate in any group activity. I started failing more classes even on subjects that I previously could have aced with my eyes closed. I spent almost three days every week suffering from migraines.For the last 6-7 months I have not been to school at all. I have met doctors and I have met with my guidance counselor for more times then I can count. My anxiety is through the roof and each time I explain my problems to the doctors and my guidance counselor, the answer is always: ""We know it is hard for you to go to school because x,y and z. **You just need to try going to school.""**Like I had not fucking thought of that before. I am suffering inside my own head, thoughts screaming how I cannot do shit and how behind I am going to be and how useless I am. For every day I started crying because I was so afraid of going to school. I could not read anything because I just could not understand the alphabets. I am nearly having panic attacks when I just think about going school. One day I became so enraged that I punched my door hoping that I would break my own arm. But thanks, I had not thought of going to school. Right now I have been on summer break again but in a week I need to go back to school but I just do not know how I can. I start crying every time I think about school. I just want to disappear and thinking about killing myself has become an everyday occurance. I just cannot handle feeling this hopeless and anxious every day when I have not even started to live independently yet. I am terrified.Any advice/stories from personal experience or just kind words would be very much appriciated.Thanks for reading this far Feeling lost, this is my situation",Depression

Any time I break down to a friend they always say just how much I have going for me because ""I am so smart"" or some other meaningless bullshit. I do not have a bad life, I am almost done with college studying physics, I have both of my parents, they care for me.

She told me ""I am going to find someone better"" and she is right. I live in my mom's basement. I never had a job, i do not want a job and i do not think I will ever be able to have one.I feel like i do not deserve to live but i somehow want to, just not like this. But i could not change anything for the better even if i wanted to. So what is the point? All i can do is think about the things that permanently ruined my body and mind.My very first memory is attending the funeral of my grandpa i was 5 years old back then. At school i have been ""beaten"". They dragged me across the floor untill my back started bleeding. They punched and kicked me every day in the same spot so i got permanent damage. They joked I would be the next schoolshooter and the teacher just laughed. They put a knife in my bag and told the teacher i threatened to kill them if they would not be my friends. I got kicked out of that school because not even the police believed me. At the next two schools at least the teachers were kind.The boyfriend of my mother at the time choked me until i lost consciousness because i pulled my cats tail and my mom just laughed. Eight years ago my father told me he does not care about me anymore because he is got a new family now before that he just used me as a babysitter for my 3 half siblings, so that he can have a relaxing weekend. I guess the oldest one was then old enough to take my babysitter part.Then i met her. Everything that happened to me no longer mattered. I was happy for about a year. Then I developed a hearing disease called hyperacusis. (short explanation: every sound is recognized so loud it causes pain) There is no cure. I had to drop out of school because of that and since then every day, all day i am in my room in the basement. If i try to go for a walk I will end up in panic because i do not want to go out there and on the way back again because i do not want go back into my room.My Girlfriend helped me get therapy. But they came to the conclusion that i am a hypochondriac simply because they never heard of my disease before and did not bother to look it up or tried to put me in group therapy completely disregarding my disease and then blaming me for ""not wanting help"" because i am afraid of people. And since then i... Well i guess i gave up.My cat died two years ago and it just broke me?I started to push the only person that ever loved me away because she tried to help me and i did not even realize it untill it was too late. I have the greatest respect for her to endure me but i also hate her for leaving me like that and all the things she said before breaking off contact. Now i am alone.I have got no one to talk. No one that cares except about my financials which is all my mom ever cared about besides her work. I cannot stay awake during day and i cannot sleep at night. I will never be happy again. I will never enjoy anything.All i can think of is that death seems to be the only way out...I would at least like to talk to someone again and just not be alone...It would be nice to not be ignored once. I just got this urge to tell someone everything about me. I hope i will not regret this.",Depression

"I have my first new therapy sesh in a half hour and I am hoping it helps. I moved back home to my parents basement last summer after going thru severe depression from my first ever relationship ending. i feel really guilty because i said and did horrible things to make my ex feel the pain i was feeling and lost the great friendship we had because i wanted so badly to keep him interested in me- just to make myself feel like i was worth something. or to distract from how meaningless my life has always felt. I am a gay almost 25 year old from a big city and i had a good network of people in high school who still live here but they are all straight and i do not relate to them much. were not close. before moving back home i lived in my college town (another big city). most of my friends there were straight too and i felt different but i had closer relationships with them. since high school I have been deeply depressed and dissociated from my life so much i just showed up got the grades and graduated. no college professors to write letters of rec for grad school. credit score sucks. stuck in a dead end job here that i do a terrible job at because it feels pointless. it requires me to go into areas of the city that have shootings every day so I am always on edge that ill get shot or carjacked. it also sucks being the only gay person in a straight male dominated space. I have switched jobs every six months or so since finishing college 3 years ago so my resume looks too bad to get a cool new job. but i also feel like working in this strange capitalistic society is a waste of my time here on earth. i feel that there is so much i could accomplish but i have no avenues to achieving them. i now have an expensive ass car note so cannot quit my job. i am afraid ill never be successful, have my own place, live a life I am happy with, fulfill any purpose. i fight suicidal thoughts daily. i feel so alone and hopeless and idk where to go from here.

"I know it sounds silly...I have not watched that much anime, only yugioh when I was a child nor have I played any anime games. Though I was playing that doodle champion island games thing on google and it was making me cry because... Idk it is all so lovely. I am fed up of trying to find hobbies, the emptiness, the loneliness, trying to distract myself, being endlessly haunted by how I feel, experimenting with medications that make things worse, no one understanding how I feel, the near constant worrying/anxiety, questions over my identity and all that shit... nothing has worked for me and it hurts so much. All that 'help' from others and trying by myself has perhaps made me understand things better, though I still struggle in a big way.Fuck, I just want a talking octopus, a ninja cat and blossom tree to hug me, eat noodles with me then go longboarding or cycling through a lovely old lane. I often wish I could exist in a cute anime world where everyone and everything was all fluffy and cuddly",Depression
I have found myself in a mental rut lately. It seems to come in cycles. I have spent most of my days in bed. Have been canceling dates. Been ghosting the ones I care about. I do not know what to do. I am wasting my 20s worrying about things that have not even happened yet. I do not know why its so hard for me to accept happiness or allow people to love me. I think I have been down too long that I have started to glamorize being sad. Shit post,Depression

In the last 70 days I have lost my wife, child, house, car, job, and next to all my financial stability.This is the first time I have been able to charge my phone in the last month and my liver is probably going to fail me if I do not kill myself, as this is the first time that I can remember myself not being drunk, excluding before all thisAll started with a rape accusation. I had just enough shit stacked against me I was almost found guilty for something only god knows I did not do, but only after my wife divorced and I was found an unfit parent.

"When I read about people withdrawing during depression, I read about how they stay at home, etc etc.I have been struggling with depression for a long time now and recently got better, but now it is back to being bad again. Ever since I quit meds it is gone this route. I hardly maintain contact with friends and have now officially decided to take a break from social media.I know this is bad but the strange thing is that I still do everything else. I leave the house everyday. I grocery shop, do the dishes, laundry, I want to go to places like art museums and go out shopping or do writing/art but I want to be alone. I am not lying in bed all the time either.For some reason I just do not want to have any contact/talk to anyone. This concerns me but I do not know why I feel like this.I am also struggling to feel emotions right now and have lost interest in what I love, I seriously do not even feel human at some points, which might be why I do not want to talk to people, because I do not want to keep up this facade that I am interested in the conversation. Yet I am still going out and doing stuff and have some interests. I just feel totally dead emotionally?

Hi. I have been depressed off and on for 9 years and I was suicidal for the first 6 of those. I was glad to say that I had been doing better these past three years but in the span of half an hour my parents have been able to tear me down to the point where I am considering doing something terrible.

"I am sorry to everyone that I have hurt by doing this. I cannot take it anymore, every day just blends into the next with this looming sense of I am just wasting my fucking life and this voice inside me constantly putting me down. Everywhere I go and have been I have been surrounded by wonderful, supportive people and yet I have never felt more alone during those moments. In these 23 years of life I have spent the past 9 just wishing and waiting for the sweet embrace of death. I just want to no longer feel alienated from the world, a robot operating a meat machine, completely devoid of purpose and emotion just living each day like clockwork. A feeling reminiscent of being a background character in a movie while the protagonists continue on their grand adventure. There honestly is no point in continuing on at this point because I cannot stand another day of If you kill yourself now then you will not get to see what the future holds! I have seen my future and there is no happy ending for myself, just images of my cold lifeless body hanging from a rafter somewhere or floating down a river, the next John Doe to be discovered by a passerby and just another statistic. So to all who saw some glimmer of potential in me or somehow found the strength to love me. Thank you, I love you and please keep continuing to spread good into this world.

"I have been suicidal since age 12 after my mother passed away. It hit me so hard, I have never felt like life had robbed me more than in that moment. More importantly, I felt like life had robbed her. But she did not choose to die. She ended her suffering.But here I am in a perfectly healthy body and what seems like a fortunate life, and yet I want to end it. I have gone through most of my life just waiting for something to push me over the edge so that I can finally die. But unfortunately, I am still here. And even worse is that I have done nothing of value or meaning. I have wasted my time and missed out on opportunities with friends.. I have not been living. I have been waiting for death. I feel so useless and empty, that I do not have a goal, or a plan, or anything. I am just kind of floating through life without direction and I do not know how to handle that realization anymore.

"I am done. I want to end this shit NOW. I cannot take it, I find that the things that I enjoy are berated by others and it hurts. Eh, I guess those things are not really that enjoyable anyway so its whatever. But nobody gives a shit what I think. I get no real support from anyone and its because I am absolutely unvalueable. I am the last person on their minds even though I try to say and do the right things. Nothing works and nothing gets better. Its always the people who I have talked to who end up happy with the last laugh.I will always be seen as potentially dangerous because of the examples of the many men before me. I will always be seen as a loser because I simply cannot compete with the billions of others out there who could easily replace me at any time. I will always feel lonely because no one wants to be around someone like me who mentions anything from this post. do not take what I say the wrong way, I am not blaming anyone else. I am not angry at anyone in particular. Its just about time I stfu and accept that I will always be unwanted. That other people will always have another someone who would they rather be with. That the negatives in life will always outweigh the positives. So no, I do not want to wait any longer than I have to to see what happens in the future. I KNOW my future, so do what you have been doing and leave me alone. I want this to be my final message before I am gone. Know that I am through trying to make new relationships and connections.

"I am not sure where to start.. there is many things wrong in my life. However I do not think I have even ""lived"" to begin with. I am 17 since mid june and I feel like I have already wasted my entire life. I have never been in a relationship.(even though I have been asked out a few times before, however I have always rejected them due to several reasons.) I have never been to a party. I have never done drugs or got drunk. I have never had many friends and I have been bullied all throughout my school life. One of the people I have considered my friend in middle school, bullied and used me. She even sexually assaulted and tried to humiliate me with that in public. I have only realized that she was not really my friend later on.My best (and only) friend that I have known since pretty much forever, never texts me back. He always tells me that he forgot to check his messages, even though I see him interact with other people and post stuff daily on the app we chat with. it is been four days since we last texted and I feel annoying and clingy. And I am pretty sure he feels that way about me. I know that everyone does. I am nothing more than a burden to everyone around me. The only time I was any good was when I was groomed into taking off my clothes and participating in sexual roleplay in front of many adult men online when I was 11-13 I guess.. I did it because of my low self-esteem, body issues(I still almost cry when looking into the mirror tbh.)and loneliness, it was the first time i felt someone actually wanted me around. I now know that it was wrong and that I was sexually abused.When I was around 11 years old I have started to get suicidal thoughts and when I was 12 I have almost stabbed myself in the stomach Infront of my older sister and my mother. Both of them called me a freak and said that I was sick in the head. I am still saying that I want to die pretty much daily and they do not really care. Even one time a few weeks ago, I have told my mother before going to bed that I will kill myself that night, because I was so sure that I was going to do it. She again did not care. Just like when I was growing up, she was rather on her phone than paying any attention to me. I do not think my dad knows about all of that. Even if he did, I am pretty sure that he would not care either. My only (childhood) memories of him are just him yelling at me. I mean I was an accidental child after all, makes sense that they rather want me gone.I think I am destined to be a failure and kill myself. I was always the weird, shy kid that barely smiled. My house burned down when I was around 6 years old, which made me even worse. The only thing that actually still gives me somewhat joy is my teddybear that my grandmother gave me for Christmas when I was 3. I know it is kind of pathetic and sad but it was one of the only things that did not burned to a crisp. Something else that gave me joy and an actual reason to live was my cat who passed away. Tomorrow it will be two year without her. I miss her so much. Most times she was the only one who comforted me when I was crying and when I felt alone. The only real one. I am a maladaptive daydreamer, I have been doing it since I can even remember. I often daydream about my favorite characters from mostly anime comforting and being with my all the time, from the moment I wake up to when I fall asleep. It makes me feel even worse and lonely. I use fiction to distract myself from everything. Scrolling through social media and seeing drawings and fanfiction of my favorite characters helps and it actually makes me feel happy sometimes. However those feelings quickly vanish when I snap back to reality.I know that I am just a pathetic and weird loner, who should just die. I have been going to a therapist since april and that does not help me either. I mean, I have gotten diagnosed with social anxiety and I am probably being tested for depression after I have got tested for autism in october. But who knows if I even live that long?I do not think that I will. My life has been miserable. And I am scared of my future. I am pretty much done with school and I have no idea what to do in life. So I should just take the easy way out.I am not sure if anyone's going to actually read this. If you do, I apologize. This post is a mess and I am pretty sure it is hard to read. I just wrote all of my current thoughts down. Also english is not my first language, sorry.Just know that I will not be doing it now or in the next few hours. Writing everything down kind of helped me with not committing suicide. But I cannot promise that I am not doing it this month or the next one. I already give in to the urge to cut myself, so giving in to the urge to ending it all is not far off, right? lol.I think I am just going to sleep soon. it is 2:10 AM where I live and I am pretty tired right now. I hope that you are alright. And I hope you have a nice day/night.(Good)bye. Why even bother with living?",Suicidal
Tried 4 times. Did permanent damage but even failed at killing myself. My life just keeps getting worse no matter how hard I try. I have a rare genetic illness that makes me extremely sensitive to drugs and alcohol.

"It would just be nice to share perspective or see how other people help support their loved ones when things get tough or said loved ones are having bad episodes. But I also understand that hearing about said perspective and experience with living with depressed persons might come off as triggering to anyone who is depressed, if I were depressed I would hate to see how my depression has affected others around me. it is an inevitable thing that happens, and it is a complicated issue. But something that I think is not talked about much in my experience.it is a hard pill to swallow but being a part of a depressed persons support group can be really traumatizing when things get bad, more so if you live with them. Like I have had to talk them down from suicide, bring them out of their intrusive suicidal ideation induced by substance abuse, cleaned up their blood after self harming occured, having to see them in a psych ward, being afraid of triggering an episode, being afraid of walking in on a dead body in your own home. And that is not accounting for being there for another relative who was in the hospital after an attempt or having a best friend who is also medically depressed. It is all around me.TW VENT AHEADAnd no matter what, despite all of that. you are always supposed to push down whatever feelings of anger and frustration or sadness you might have in favor of taking care/supporting the person that needs the most help at the moment. And feelings of resentment happen but I personally do not want to feel that way, I feel that letting those negative emotions take over helps no one, much less the person you want to help. But it is so hard sometimes, and it is hard to talk about without sounding emotionally selfish to some capacity, because you have a whole medically depressed person right there! so you automatically feel guilty for even taking your feelings in consideration. Like ""how dare you be negatively affected my someone else's depression, fuck you! their well being and mental health is important than yours at the moment! Suck it up!"" and I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but it is the reality of things. Like whatever I am feeling needs to take a back seat because I need to reserve my emotional energy for when another depressive episode from one of my relatives rolls around. And yes this person has a psyche, a therapist, and meds. If they did not have those things they would have definitely been gone by now, but it still seems like it is going to be a while until they are able to manage their depression. it is just really hard and I feel so alone in these types of feelings I am having, these feelings that i feel like I cannot afford to have. But that is not realistic and these feelings are there and they are eating away at me, it makes me want to run away from it all. But again it can always be written off by a statement like this ""well whatever you are feeling I can guarantee you the depressed person is having a worse time than you right now"" and...they would be right!....and I go back to feeling like shit and the cycle continues. But I feel so written off constantly because I am in such constant and close proximity to depression, i feel like I am not allowed to be cared about or acknowledge whatever it is I am going through or feeling. I just do not know if anyone feels this way. VENT OVERThat said, I think a therapist would be the best answer to my plight but I do not have access to one, no healthcare, I am the process of having that be sorted out. And I know you can only do so much as a support, you are not supposed to shoulder to much of a depressed persons burden, but it is different when you live with them, you see the depression and you experience their episodes from the outside, except you are not exactly a bystander either and you got to get your hands dirty. So that is why i wanted to know if there is any collective of people who has experienced any situation similar. I do not know where else to ask this, but is there a support group for relatives living with depressed persons? or a support group for the support group of a depressed individual? it is a unique experience and I would like to speak with others who have experience living with medically depressed persons.",Depression
"Hi, I am curious to know how others distract themselves from everything they are going through. My boyfriend has depression, and he does not have any interests or a passion to distract him if he needs to, and since we have some distance I cannot always physically be there for him to be the distraction he needs. When I got rlly sad I usually was triggered by something (not always ofc, sometimes i would just wake up that way). I learned to deal with that by doing something that distracts me, but even when I was depressed I still had a lot of interests and things that I like to do or atleast that would distract me from whatever was triggering me. I just do not know how to help him in any other way rather than going on reddit and see what helps for others to hopefully try it out and let it be something that helps for him too. I just do not know what to tell him or what to do or how to support him since I do not know what I would have done if I had nothing that distracted me, i think i would be doomed idk... What helps to take your mind off things?",Depression

"I am a mom and wife to two beautiful boys and husband. It all started with insomnia due to going back to school, getting covid and trying to homeschool. I got horrible anxiety and stopped sleeping so I tried several sleeping pills to no avail which led to a prescription of Lexapro and Temazepam. The Lexapro sent me into a spiral and after 5 weeks I had to stop it and have had horrible side effects and am now trying to taper off of Temazepam. I do t know which symptoms are from which drug withdrawal but I have reacted so horribly to theses drugs I dream of only having insomnia again. Week after week things never get better. I am anxious, suicidal, and have all kinds of strange symptoms that Dr.s do not understand or want to prescribe more drugs for. I am afraid the meds have caused permanent damage even in the short time I have taken them, and now its like being trapped in hell. I can barely care for myself let alone my kids. Suicide seems like the only way out. I cannot put them through this anymore. But I do not want to die. What would you do if you were literally going crazy, but cannot take meds, but also do not want to permanently damage your family either? Mom of 2 in bento withdrawal",Suicidal

They seemed a little mad at me when i told them and now i do not know how to feel.

"A successful person can say million philosophical quotes because he achieved everything that he wanted and living a comfortable life. Most people get success in their life because they are gifted(Good or at least reasonable IQ, adequate confidence, some important skills, etc.). What about a person like me, who is handicapped in everything that gives success. I work very hard but I could not be able to do things properly such as my exams, presentations, interviews, etc. I often fail in everything because I was not born with a good IQ. An opportunity has been never given in my life, and gifted people give me some non-sense lectures and philosophy on how they have achieved their success. Why do not they understand that I have a different capacity compared to them? I feel like I do not want to live anymore among the people who never understand me.

"it is here again. The little voice in my head telling me that life are not worth living no more. I do not know what caused me to snap this time. Or the last, or the time before but by some sorta cosmic joke, I am still here and alive, pretty much everything from joining gang violence on purpose to drinking poision. 6 times I have attempted suicide in the past. I am sure I need to check myself into an institution but tbh it really are not worth it money wise as funny as it sounds. I feel weirdly calm about all this and even have a 3 page note written out to my girlfriend of 5 years lnd friends and family. I guess I am just writing this because I feel literally empty. This most recent attempt is another car crash. On the side of a mountain. I felt the rush, like dopamine hitting the back of my skull. Grateful that there would be no more of me if I did roll off that side, the car hit a rock and slid to the opposite end and thus I am here writing this. I wrote here before but deleted it. I know my psychology is all fucked up here. And words can only do so much so why would writing anonymously change anything I think to myself. I have a will to live I guess, well not by my prior actions obviously. But 90% of me is dead. Throughout all my horrific attempts I still have yet to break a single bone in my body much less get whiplash. Hence the cosmic joke. I honestly wish it was easy to die. I think the reason I have yet to is guilt for my loved ones who will have to suffer monetary and emotional pain for my selfish actions. If anything it would be better if I were just erased. Like I never even existed. That would be nice. I think the reason I write this is to grasp at straws. A bit of hope that my life somehow has meaning in all of this. I really cannot see anything in front of me that is worth living as harsh as that sounds. And that things would be better off without me getting in the way. I do not know really. I am at an impass yet again. How I got through before I do not know and still do not.

"This is my first time posting here or anywhere actually, but I just really wanted to share this with someone. I have lost all my interest in things I used to enjoy the most. I think it happened three or four years ago, but I could not accept the fact that I do not enjoy the thing I used to love the most (it was animated movies), so I kept forcing myself to watch them, but every time I kept having weird thoughts and just would give up watching them thinking that Ill start enjoying later. To be honest, the fact that I lost all my interest made me even more depressed. Now I do not enjoy anything. Listening to music does not bring joy anymore, I skip meals and I do not feel excited for food as I used to before. I used to like cooking, but now frying an egg seems like an impossible task to do. I started getting panic attacks last fall and struggled with thanatophobia for couple years, and now I just have no energy to do anything. I feel anxious all the time. Sometimes I try watching some tv show, but for some reason I just cannot watch it even if I want to. I cannot sleep at nights and only fall asleep when its 7-9am.

"Title speaks for itself. For years a close friend and I have been working on getting a house. He ended up having a child with his girlfriend and now they are married, but it was all planned that she would come along and be in our house when we got it. Well, plans changed and my friends wifes parents talked my friends wife out of it and used me as an excuse saying that I am not safe to be around because I went to the mental hospital in the past. They said I am dangerous and Ill end up killing everyone including the kid. They say that, and then say how my firiend is not ready to buy a house, but then forces him on a loan application to buy a house with the in-laws. So now, I am not going to have a home, my friend is locked in with his in-laws, his in-laws have taken total control of my friends marriage and now will not let me anywhere close to the house. Knowing this is how people feel about me (and multiple parties at that) it just brings me down. Ever since I went to the mental hospital, I have been treated like shit by so many people. I have been called a monster, a demon, a threat to society. All because I could not handle my emotions anymore. I wish I could talk to my friends in-law to their face and tell them to tell me I should have killed back then. Honestly I believe it though. I should have just killed myself back then. Its evident the world would have been better off without me, since people are so annoyed by my existence. Jokes on them. I am going to kill myself and make sure people know so they can celebrate my death. I hate this world, and here is another reason.

"I have struggled with anxiety depression my whole life. I have extreme anxiety which I think ultimately makes me depressed. I put off dealing with the issues for years, because of stigma and just not understanding what was going on. In my late teens my mom finally forced me start medicine and see a therapist. I had a lot of bad circumstances, but after I graduated college my life suddenly started looking up. A few months after graduating the most amazing thing happened. I met this cute, funny, guy through mutual friends - and he asked me out on a date. There was an instant attraction. We talked everyday and began dating officially a month later. It was the happiest Id ever been in my life. I had a job, I moved out of my parents house, I had friends, and I had a loving boyfriend. My life was finally coming together how I wanted it. I thought, maybe my depression and anxiety are finally gone. I was always anxious about something bad happening because my life seemed too good to be true.Then - just a few weeks after we celebrated our 6 month anniversary, my boyfriend came over to my house one day and dumped me. I was completely blindsided. He told me he just was not as invested in the relationship as he should be, and was not falling in love with me. He cut me off and never reached out, even on my birthday. My life fell apart. All of my anxiety and depression came back in full swing.I realized that I am not valued or competent at my job, all of my friends have boyfriends who they would much prefer to hang out with.

He thinks that he is holding me back and that he is not good for me, and he admitted that he was considering breaking up with me because of this. But I can clearly see that this is not he wants, and he is just hurting himself by doing so. He also admitted he is trying to push me away because he is hurting me, but will not communicate with me about what hes going through or how he feels.I have tried as many things as I can think of: listening/being here for him, suggested doctor visits for trying meds/counselling, mindfulness, suggested exercises and to meet up with friends and family. there is more, but that is some examples. Despite this, he continues to tell me that he wants to give up on himself and keeps saying that we should not be together, quoting: I wish things were easier, I wish things did not mess up the way it did. But I just want to let you go because you do not deserve any of that and I will keep hurting you if we keep going But I am 100% sure that he does not want to give up on us and that he is just so deep in his depression right now that he cannot see a way out so hes pushing me away to because me less hurt, but its actually hurting me way more to know hes thinking about leaving me.

Following this, he recently found out that a family member has been diagnosed with cancer, which he is understandably struggling with. We were also supposed to be moving in together within the next month but I can tell he is struggling from the pressure of finding a place. In the past two weeks, we took a 1 week break of not talking to each other to try and reflect on things. We both found this extremely difficult and are now suffering because of it. Yesterday, he told me he was considering breaking up with me during the break which was a huge shock to, also he has never said anything like this to me before.

I am not very outgoing and do not have a partner so I do not really have any reason other than work or going out with friends to leave the house. But staying in the house all the time makes me feel like I have been missing out on really important life events.I have noticed over the past year it is been getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings and throughout the day it just feels like a slog. I have become very distant from the work I am doing and do not take it as seriously anymore. It does not really feel like work at this point, just something I happen to do during the day. Everyday's the same and when something goes wrong I feel quite intimidated because I feel like it is invading my private space.I have tried writing and wanted to exploit home working to give me an opportunity to really practice my skills but it is been a disaster and I have not written a single story since the pandemic began. it is my aspiration to be a writer and I feel like I have just flushed it down the toilet. My mood has completely turned me off writing altogether and it just feels pointless at this stage. It sucks too because I get pretty excited about it.In February and March I was having major suicidal thoughts and although they have went away the odd feeling pops back into my head which makes me worry that one of these days I am going to do something to myself. I have tried to make use of mental health resources but I do not really feel like I want to help myself, I check out a website or have a chat with someone and then I drop it again until I have another depressive nosedive. I also contacted a therapist last year but I was not comfortable with phone or video chat therapy due to privacy issues.I badly want to have meaning in life but right now it feels like I live for other people and I am really not enjoying work right now. it is not even the work itself, it is just the thought of doing it. Recently we have been pretty quiet but sitting around doing nothing all day does not help either. there is talk of going back to the office which I think might help if I get back into a routine again but most of my colleagues do not want to go back so I am worried I will be alone, plus it is dependent on if we really need to go into the office (which we really do not as we have shown we can work from home) and Covid cases. there is also certain aspects about office working that I think I will struggle to get used to again, so I feel pretty divided. Covid has completely destroyed my social skills.Sorry if this is a massive rant, I am not exactly sure what to write but I just feel pretty down right now. it is late and I cannot sleep which is when my mind goes on a tangent and attacks itself. I just want to feel like I have some sort of meaning in life and something to hold onto and develop. I was hoping that thing would be my writing but I do not feel like touching it right now because of how unmotivated I feel. I feel like the last year has been an absolutely waste of time and I just feel very replaceable and blank at this point. Feel like life is on hold due to working from home",Depression

"Everyday I see people just doing the same thing but not making any changes. I watch obese people walking into fast food joints. People just walking on this treadmill of work, spend money, sleep and repeat. Ever since I left the country in 2016 I have just been feeling like this place does not work for me. I do not want to become a slave to the matrix and live a boring life of paying bills and working some boring job and having to pay rent or a mortgage for the rest of my life. it is just stupid to me. But what I really realized is how depressing the US is to me. Seeing elderly people living on the streets, seeing the government slowly turn the country into what Orwell warned, and seeing people just sitting idly by and letting it all happen. I feel like it is a lost because to even speak yo about it. I saw a Jim Morrison quote about this and it fully resonated. I find myself not connecting to 99% of people here. Everyone is just so self obsessed and dull. I do appreciate how many different interesting people are on Reddit though. At the same time I believe people are more authentic on the internet than they are IRL. Regardless, I see alot of people doing alot of cool things, and feel a better connection with people here than in the physical world. I just want to make music and build my brand in peace, not having to worry about bills or paying rent and it is sheerly frustrating to try and do it here. I think I just have to go to Africa for a few months and be around my people. I realized that living in th US makes me depressed and I do not believe I fit in here",Depression
"Okay, I do not even know how to express my feelings but I will try. I have been lied to in my life by being told if I would work hard and get a good job I would be happy.This cannot be further from the truth. I am deeply upset. Something about me: I am short and an ugly man (nope do not even try to tell me otherwise I once posted on one of those am I ugly subs and I got a max rating of 3 and an average of 1).Okay, so my problem is still that I get made fun of and I am not able to do anything about it and for some reason people think that whenever someone talks about being ugly they are going to talk about dating and women. But I want to talk about more to be honest.Men constantly make fun of me and put their arms on top of my head and whatnot and there is nothing that I could do about it because I am immediately met with ""What are you going to do?"". Hell, society even took my right away for being angry because if I would be called Napoleon, if I will joke back then I would be called arrogant and if I will listen to insults (or jokes as people call it) I would be called a loser. it is a lose-lose-lose situation.I am surprised that men just laugh when I mention my height, they are like ""Oh I just cannot take you seriously"" and god forbid if you get into some sort of management postion people hate taking orders from someone who is short as if I have worked less than them my entire life and as if I do not deserve it. I cannot retaliate or get angry because that would put me on the front page of reddit. So I quietly take insults till I can and after that threshold which is just over, I will not be here anymore.let us talk about dating. Oh and please I am not saying women owe me anything because they do not. On the same note what the fuck is up with the people who go around everywhere saying ""NoBoDy oWeS yOu AnYtHiNg"" well of course they do not but at the same time there is something called being a fucking human. If somebody is hanging off a cliff and you know if you do not help the person will die? What would you do? Well I would go and help that person not because I owe him anything but because that is called being a fucking human. If you are parents love you unconditionally then would you say the same thing as ""Oh gee I do not owe you anything""Now this is one of the cruelest place for being a short man that I have ever seen, I get told everytime some version of ""you are cool and have an awesome personality but I would date you *insert physical characteristics* but it is okay do not worry you will find someone"". Well I have not found anyone and not only that I even asked them after getting rejected ""If you do not mind me asking what do you think I should improve in or is it that there is just something intrinsic about me that is just incompatible between us?"" And you can pretty much guess what I get told.Although I am not going to lie but the way that some women just laugh when I approach them is just cruel and it crushes me from inside like nothing else, I mean all physical pain does not seem like anything to me at that moment. Pro tip: If you want to destroy a man just say 'man up' believe me that guy would be completely and absolutely destroyed.And not only that this is making me bitter and is changing my political views, turns out I am becoming what I hate, I hate people who show no emotion, I hate people who treat other people cruelly for things that they do not control. But now I do not want to care about people or whatever happens across the world because I know when I would need help nobody would be there for me.Not only these things but things like both unattractive men and women are treated differently in courts (I can link the study of you folks want).You know what, I am frustrated at the fact that I cannot let my angry out, I am angry at the fact that I cannot be upset because then I would be insecure.I am tired of pretending I am not upset, I am tired of pretending that I laugh your jokes. I do not. I am tired of seeing people making fun of short guys on internet and pretending I am too cool to get hurt.. I am tired of pretending that I am comfortable in my body because I am not. I did not chose to be this way. I do not want to be treated and respected differently than you attractive people. I am tired of pretending that I do not get crushes after 23 consecutive NosI wish somehow I could show the world and tell them that I am a human too. I feel bad. Everytime you make fun of me I feel stripped of my humanity. And I am especially especially tired of people telling me ""just be yourself"" or ""put some effort in"" and I have been told by those people that I put effort in on putting effort. And those people who say it are always good looking.I am sick, hard work or money did not buy me any happiness. Is it so bad that I want to feel loved and wanted. Shit my own parents made fun of me.I am tired of pretending I am comfortable I am not. I have no zeal none at all to live. Tired of being belittled constantly.",Suicidal

"At the beginning of last year I was employed, married, had great credit, had an apartment, a car, and a computer for entertainment. Events that followed;1. My wife let the insurance lap on our car and I got ticketed after being crashed into.2. This happened right after I came out as trans. 3. Wife could not and would not take me to physical therapy.4. Out of work, because I have to be according to doctor and lawyer. 5. Lawyer tell me I cannot move forward with lawsuit until I get medical bills and tests, which I cannot get to or pay for.6. Wife aborts planned child because I am trans while out at work.7. My job fires me because I cannot come into work because wifes car is totalled and I was a driver8. In moment of distress and grief I try to kill myself.9. I got baker acted in the hospital and not allowed to have phone or connection to outside.10. While I am inside the hospital against my will for a month my wife refused to pay any of my bills, forfeited our apartment, threw away everything that I owned including multi thousand dollar computer and trashed my truck.11. Wife withdrew all money from my bank accounts and police and bank say its legal because she had my pin.So, now I am homeless, Transportationless, moneyless, clotheless and with no credit.It seems like everyone here would tell me that things will get better, I just need to sleep on a couch or at a homeless shelter and put inordinate amounts of effort into building my life back up to less than what I started with, even though I have a shit ton of mental health issues not being treated that make it nearly impossible to keep putting in effort.People will carelessly tell me to go get help at places that I cannot get to reliably, or tell me to do this or that, even though they do not have to do those things themselves.I cannot even reliably get a job because of my credit and lack of Transportation in the USA.I am constantly in a loop of being at my lowest and I need a fucking handout and I cannot even say that without people thinking I am greedy or entitled to money I did not earn, but I am also stuck not being able to earn any money.

"Hi. So a bit of background.My dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. When my mum had me (21), she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage, although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. My mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. This is why my dad has never divorced, hes never said it outright but I reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.His relationship with me as a child used to be good, but it was always tainted with his anger. He would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazines/toys, or just for nothing if work had been bad. Essentially as I grew up, I became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. He took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. One time when I was 14, I went to the wrong street for him to pick me up (one street over) and as soon as I got in the car, he started driving as bit, hit the brakes then screamed in my face I HATE YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. He would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. I have not had anything like that recently with him, but I do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. Overall, I very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and I, that he wishes life could have been different.He has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. He has maybe three friends? But he only sees them at work.I have suspect this has caused him to be depressed, bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. For a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. My mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked (mental breakdown?) but he was fine the next day. I did not say anything because I was scared, terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. The only person I would ask about stuff like this is my dad, but that is not an option. My mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.Tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what I should do when he dies, get everything in order. I said to him no let us not, because you are not going to die for a good while, to which he responded with you will be lucky if I am here next week. He then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. I am terrified. I think hes going to do it. I love him so much please help me here. I do not know how to help him. I do not even know if I am overreacting or what. What should I do. I think my Dad might kill himself",Suicidal

"Last year I went through some horrible interpersonal shit on top of the pandemic. This ended up triggering a massive bout of depression.

I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives, but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long. Honestly I could write a novel because there are so many sub-categories to what is adding to my mental health crisis, but where do you even start when you have never been heard?I am so tired.

"I just want to type this all out because I truly do not know what else to do right now while I sit here contemplating everything. Basically TLDR; my wife has now given me an ultimatum of being in a poly dynamic or we split up. I love her so much, and she had alone given me so much more meaning in life when I met her and made me such a better person. I do not want to be without her no matter what that means but I want her to be happy too. Earlier this year she had been talking to an online friend about the idea of being with him and wanting to and started talking to me on the side bringing up what if we opened our relationship up and went through a lot of emotional and devastating talks about this and I was horribly depressed for months and even suicidal. Eventually she stopped talking to him at all for other reasons and I went to a psychiatrist because I have always had pretty severe depression but did not want to take medicine for it and had finally broken down and wanted to try it as a last resort type thing, like what if it really did all come down to a chemical imbalance. This surprisingly worked with no downside whatsoever and we talked more and more about the possibilities of being poly and I did a lot more researching and talking to people I knew who were in that lifestyle and agreed to give it a shot and thought that I actually did want it and it would be ok. I had been dating a girl for a little while and we have done sexual stuff and she was kind of dating this guy and they had not done anything serious. I noticed that when I did stuff with the new girl it just did not feel great for no reason whatsoever and I kept brushing it off as me being anxious over this new lifestyle. Yesterday my wife had finally told me that her and the guy she was dating did sexual stuff and at that moment, the one that I had thought about so many times to try to prepare myself for and thought I was for sure ok with, I absolutely broke down and told her that I cannot do this. None of my experiences with others have been good and I still cannot truly fathom how people can live this way. I just want her to love me and everything go back to the way it was before. Today while at work she sent me a wall of text essentially saying that I was the problem and that she is going to continue being poly but in the same breath saying how she loves me more than anything which makes zero sense. But it came down to we either stay poly or we split up so I do not see how she could love me more than anything but still prefer to divorce. Anyways I told her that I guess we are going to divorce then because she basically made the decision already but I truly cannot live on without what I had before. I truly felt like I was in heaven being with her all these years and was ready to tackle anything the future had but now thinking about being without her I am just ready for the end. I would love to do something that was more peaceful and painless like the exit bag method but it is now too time consuming and I want to be done soon. And if you read all this way through then understand that I know this has been all my fault for agreeing and getting involved with it and breaking down after hearing her. I am not blaming anyone else but myself for this, I promise, I just want out and she can live her life happily. Also, also, I know I have posted things in here before and obviously I got through them, majority having to do with the earlier in the year issues that went away and I got on medication, but this is different. Things are actually ending in my life and I cannot deal with it. Anyways, I think this truly is goodbye. I think I am finally going to do it (long story)",Depression
"I just do not feel like doing anything anymore, let it be playing with my animals (three dogs and two cats), going outside, assisting my dad with work, hanging out with friends, or anything, really.I am already a mess. I stay up all night just laying in bed. I stopped doing the things I love, and just stopped caring about everything.People always say the same thing. ""Get a therapist"" or ""it will be better soon."" I know they are lying though. I have been like this for about five years now. Heh, my dad always says that he gets it. However he does not. He does not feel like he is constantly drowning in sorrow.I cannot get a therapist because then I will have to use my parent's money, and then they will find out how I am, and I do not want that.

"I have suffered from social anxiety and swings of depression for years (28 y/o). Most of my friends I have kept joined the military long term so I only communicate every once in a while through text or call. I met a girl almost a year ago who had so many common interests it was crazy. Even the mental health problems. We used to work together, but I recently got a new job. We saw eachother almost every day, and talked EVERY single day, without getting into too much detail we were MUCH closer than your average best friend. I have been working on myself for a little over a year, and Id say my mental state for the most part is much better than its been the past few years, and she has been much help with my journey. But at times, I would start arguments with her over minuscule things, that at the time I feel are big. Last week started many little fights that added up. I had the first panic attack I have had in years, and stupid me started drinking (I am not an alcoholic, I just needed something to clear my head) She asked for space, but I kept texting her, I told her I was going to commit suicide because of her ignoring me, and that I was going to go to her house. (I was not going to actually go anywhere as I was inebriated, and I was not intending on physically harming her if that is what it sounds like, I just looked for any outlet of attention). At this point there was no return. I quickly realized the damage I had done, no one should have to deal with the emotional trauma I gave her. Its been almost a week and she wants nothing to do with me. I am not typically a dependent person, but in my entire life I have never met someone so relatable, and I screwed it all up. I have made a few attempts to mend things, but she wants no part. I know the answer is give her space and expect that its over and move on, but I feel terrible. I now have no one, I am alone, but worse, I have hurt her to the point of her being scared of me. My entire family line suffers from depression or bipolar, and I see no light at the end. I screwed up a year long friendship in hours time",Depression
"I have been thinkin on writin here for months.I have been having suicidal thoughts for years, they get stronger at times, n they are back extremely strong right now. Nothing seems to make sense. I know everyone hates me. I know the world would be either a better place without me, or nothing would change. I do not know if I want to keep on going anymore. I hate myself so much, and the thought that I only annoy people makes me want to die even more.I tried joining groups of interests to make myself stay alive. Because I have to. Because others need me. But I do not feel like I fit anywhere. there is always someone better than me. Of course. I am nothing special in the end anyway.I both want to die very much but also am scared of death. I feel so pathetic feeling this way. I do not know what to do anymore. Nothing seems to help as I seem to always get back into this state. No matter how hard I try. I just wish I was better. But i do not know how I could even do that. I also do not know what I am trying to do by writing all of this n posting it here. I just do not know what to do anymore. I feel so lost. I feel so many things at once yet nearly nothing at all. Its all just so confusing and I feel so alone in this. I do not want to bother anyone either. I hope writing this will not turn out bad or anything.I just do not know what to do.

"it is been two weeks since I have been out of the hospital. I feel fantastic. I was hiding my feelings. I am a transgender man and I was not supported by my parents, but they finally educated themselves. And they respect me. I stood at the edge and I ran towards it, but I stopped. I thought, ""that is a steep drop. What if I fall? What if I fall and it lasts too long and I scream and what about the anticipation of waiting to die and *what if I do not actually ascend?*"" I sat down and called the cops. I spent 6 days in the hospital in the psych ward and I have been more open to myself about my feelings. I also realize that for me, suicide will not work because I will have to do all of this over again and that does not sound fun. They put me back on antidepressants, and ones that work real well. I feel fantastic. They worked like a charm.

Ever since she left me, it is getting worse. it is like there is this voice in my head that says I am stupid and useless and there is no way to turn it off. It has been getting worse lately.

I have taken it upon myself to finally start making healthy changes in my life to recreate a headspace that invites more positive thoughts. Some things I have done the past few months to force myself out of the comfort of my sadness: - I have started journaling again. Every morning I try and write down one thing I am grateful for in my life. My therapist also recommended I journal every time my mood plummets so I can get it off my mind and on to paper. - I quit vaping. Vaping was a terrible crutch I used to aid my anxiety, it was not an easy quite but its been a couple months now and it feels good to be free. - I started reading again. I replaced my phone time at night with books so I can get away from social media. I am extra proud of this because its been years since I have read for pleasure and I forgot how much I loved it. I just finished my first book since starting again and I hope this is something that I can keep up. - I started learning how to reach out to friends and family when I am having a bad day. Swallowing my pride was hard. I believed I always had to be 100% happy all the time so no one would ever worry about me or think less of me. I am grateful for the support system I have.

I thought I hated my body, I thought that I was sad because the boy I liked did not like me, I thought I was sad because my parents never understood me. But those were all the things I would tell other people when they asked if I was okay, although I never really cared about any of that. The truth is I do not really feel anything. I try to pretend I care about things to seem normal to other people and I pretended for so long that I ended up believing my own lies. I was so out of touch with my feelings I had no idea I was actually depressed, I thought I was living life the way it is supposed to be lived but it never felt right. I have never taken my future seriously, in fact I have never taken anything in my life seriously. I got arrested for shoplifting, and while my friend cried I started laughing, because I really could not care. I do not care about my studies, I only have good grades because I am asked to. I do not even feel happy or proud when I get a good grade. I do not have any real life project or expectations for my future. I have been living all this time letting other people decide for me because I do not really want anything. Nothing motivates me. When I was a child I liked to draw, to read, to write. None of those things motivate me anymore. I thought I was happy because I partied, I drank, O smoked weed and hung out with my friends. I thought I was happy because those things made me feel alive. When I am alone I just pretend I am living a different life, but I never thought that was fucked up because I thought it was normal. I want to know if people that are not depressed experience life differently. Do they seriously care about things? Everytime something bad happens to me, it is almost like it happens to someone else. I feel emotions as if I was deep inside of the ocean and there were muffled sound coming form the outer world. it is almost like I drown my own emotions. If someone insults me, if someone hurts me, if someone rejects me I never really cry about it or feel sad or anything at all. it is like I have become numb.Nothing makes sense. Nothing here makes sense. it is like I do not know how to be alive. I thought it was completely normal to go to sleep late, to eat too much or too little, to feel tired all the time, to never be able to concentrate. But now some stupid online test tell me that those are symptoms of depression. I thought everybody was just pretending like I did. This is such a different type of depression. I have experienced hate for myself, I have experienced anxiety and hate for my body. I thought THAT was depression, and the nothingness and the pretending were all just part of my personality, just the way I was born. I do not know how to be different, I do not know my feelings or myself. I do not really know or want or feel anything. it is the strangest feeling, and I know it is been there all the time but I never recognized until now. I think I have been depressed for years but I did not know",Depression
"I know it is so hard, to feel totally alone in the world, isolated at a disconnect. Remember that we all struggle alone, we all need people, we need people to make us feel alive, make us feel known, they become our safe place, where we run away too, who is arms we curl up and hide in. it is ok not to be ok alone. it is ok to desperately want and long for people, comfort, mutuality, touch, connection, emotion.Your not weak for that, you have not failed. it is not a societal expectations for, a neccecity, it is your want, you desire that, and you are deserved of it.I know practically it is like what do you do? But first and foremost remember in mind that your ok for wanting that, needing that. it is not an impossible ask, it is just very difficult for you right now.Friendship is a part of life, a thing that happens as you live, more people, more opportunities will come along line as you live. You have not missed your moment, this was not your one shot from which ever after you will be alone. You have the whole off your life to work on this.Just keep trying, keep working at it, learning and growing, trying to work the problems your facing, understanding what it takes for you to have the friendships that you want. Think of it as less a task, with a set end, an objective. it is exploration. People are, each and every one, ends in them selves.it is hard where your at right now, I know because I am facing something similar, I have been alone some many years now, lest some occasional offchance.

I have handed out 1000s of resumes, and I have a lot of experience and certificates in trades and engineering but I think what my ex said about me previously is preventing me from screening. We recently relocated and my girlfriend found employment. My car mirror was vandalized and my insurer will not be covering the repair it seems, so I cannot drive to work.

"Hopefully my behaviour can help find out why. I tend to be very apathetic, apart from when I am stuck into researching my favourite subject which is nutrition and have become very impatient with my former favourite hobby I engaged in to relieve boredom, which are video games. I have some suicidal ideation, because nutrition can only provide so much information and find it extremely difficult to start new hobbies like learning an instrument. I have so far failed to mention my autism, which I inherited from my purely parental lineage and had diagnosed from a professional and autism has been linked with depression, although I do doubt my diagnosis to a small degree. My heart rate is in the 90s which is a possible indicator that something is wrong with me since higher heart rates are linked with depression, shorter life spans and a greater chance of CVD, although I am exercising and eating some legumes to lower it as much as possible. I am taking lamogtrigine which is supposed to stabilize my mood, as my consultant thinks that I may have Bipolar and I am growing some broccoli sprouts to treat my autism as it is the only shown treatment of autism there is, if I even have it in the first place.(I am whole food starch based, but I understand if you do not want to leave animal products behind, as my oldest sister still likes them.)My main issue with making friends is anticipatory anxiety, possibly induced by church up until we stopped attending, much to the dismay of the pastors at 14 and maybe attending school at 14 after a history of only homeschooling. I am completely fine in the presence of others, like at school and can tolerate them fairly well outside of regular social meetings, but the main reward is walking out of the regular meetings for sure, knowing I have some time before I encounter them again. Quickly going back to nutrition, I think I might be deficient in both calcium and magnesium, which seem to have a role in mood, alongside the obvious ones being bones and muscles and I am also taking ashwaganda. My grandfather on my fathers side, the autistic and very quiet one who only every talked to my mother once in his entire life, thankfully it being the pleasant topic of his civil engineering career. (He shook hands with the queen for an important construction project once, despite being very middle class.) I also have problems falling asleep at regular times, but no issue getting it consistently. I must further mention that I have had severe seperation anxiety based on my mother, to the point where I very rarely could be left with strangers and could not even be held by my own father, who has suffered from general anxiety for as long as he can remember.I grew up in a Christian community and also a completely secular sailing club, which gave me the feeling of being Jekyll and Hyde before having known about the book. But both feelings where equally enjoyable. Although I was in a Christian environment much more. This was balanced out by three and a half years of schooling I suppose, although one of my friends at church who I do not see anymore thought religion was stupid and my mother and I think he could have been autistic. I keep in sparse contact with one friend from my Christian-hood and none of the good friends I made in public school.And yet, after all of my research into nutrition and other lifestyle changes, such as aerobic fitness, what could be the because of my low mood? Any supplements you guys would recommend, as I am also taking boron which is a unessential mineral that boosts testosterone a fair amount among other things.Thanks for reading this long post.

For a few years, I even thought my problems could go away for good. Its unfortunate they cannot. I was very lucky to be loved but love cannot get rid of the maggots in my brain. She really tried to help me and understand me though. She was even willing to sacrifice her health to help me. A few days ago, I told her I was self harming again. She begged me to not off myself. It was like she knew that it was coming. I never even told her about how I was researching methods. She was screaming at me to not leave her here alone. I cannot stop thinking of how much this is going to fuck her up. She already struggles with bpd. This is going to really ruin things. She finally started taking therapy seriously too. I know she is strong enough to live through this and she has better emotional connections with people so she will be fine in a few weeks. I would not be able to live without her. But she would be able to live without me. She is so much stronger. I wish she never knew me because then she would not be sad over my death and I probably could have done this a long time ago. I wish I was capable of spending a lifetime with her. She told me once that I was the only person she knew would never hurt her. And now I am going to hurt her. I do not know how to tell her that I do not care about myself when I am alone. I only care about myself when other people need me for something. I wish I had better thoughts. This is why I would never leave a suicide note behind. I am going away forever and I cannot even think of what to say or how to word my thoughts. I wonder if anyone is even going to bother reading all this. It does not really matter though I suppose. I just had my last conversation with my best friend",Suicidal
I am 16. I failed 10th grade because of struggling with online school and now I am on probation for truancy for 6 months. That really is not that big of an issue for me because I can pass the drug tests and I am a mostly behaved kid. My parents are divorced and they do not get along at all. I see my dad maybe 2-3 times a month and its only ever for a few hours. He beat me once when I was young and I had a horrible stepmom who neglected me and verbally abused me for years. He never got in trouble as my mom did not press charges but that and my stepmom basically ruined our relationship. I have a girlfriend with severe depression and anxiety issues. I will not go into specifics for her sake but Ill just say her alcoholic father caused a lot of her trauma. This girl means the world to me and I want her for as long as I am alive but i just do not know anymore. She smokes weed and vapes and it kills me to watch it. I always try to convince her to stop but she says you know what you signed up for. When I try to talk about it she makes me out as the bad guy every time. It genuinely crushes me like nothing else. All but 1 of her friends are what Id consider addicted to weed and nicotine and they are horrible influences. I try to tell her she needs/deserves better friends and then she calls me controlling. I truly am not controlling I just want the best for her. Her mom and I have discussed it and she agrees with me. Idk it just feels like I am trapped but do not want to escape. I just got my first job at Kohls and i get paid $10/hour more than minimum wage so I feel like I should be happy but honestly I just do not care. I feel like my life is just running on repeat. Same bs day after day and I am so tired. I do not have the guts to end my life but I just want it to stop. I feel lost and alone and like nothings worth it anymore,Suicidal

"I am a final year student about to enter the workforce. I come from a privileged background where I did not have to work part time to pay for my school fees and I live comfortably with my parents. I have a lot to be grateful for but I feel like there is nothing worth living for.

"Ever since i was little my parents have always fought and blamed everything on me, just turned 18 yesterday and still nothing has changed. My parents put there expectation on me initially becoming a tennis player, so they trained me for 11 years of my life, i had no childhood as i would immediately after 3.30pm after eating would play tennis 3 hours for years on end, high school was difficult as i was unable to multitask between tasks. (i was good at tennis, but i know my limitations so i told them i give up) they blamed me for months on end for ruing there dreams and money, i should have told them when i was younger but if i did i was scared what would happen to me as my parents hated/despised my existence if i was no use to them.Then i aimed to become a doctor, year 11, age 15, after breaking up with my first girlfriend who was my emotional scapegoat since my parents hated me, our relationship was toxic and my first love chose another individual because i was too much of a coward to ask her out. During when i had a girlfriend year 10, my parents would antagonise me that i should not fall in love, it ruined my tennis career and education. During my relationship with my girlfriend i realised the way my parents where treating me, my lack of social awareness and how enclosed my life was (did not know youtube, anime, insta, etc. till i was 15). So i slowly began to shut them out of my life, both parents would antagonise me, act like my support, but then immediately backstabbed me when they had the chance, blame everything on me and have me as a common enemy (this was norm in my life and still is). My parents still antagonise me for falling in love to the point, I am so depressed that my friends slowly forgot about me and the only form of happiness i still have left is anime, lego or games.My parents antagonise me on how successful they are and how much of a disgrace i'am compared to them, I am a freeloading leech that takes everything for granted, whilst offering nothing in return. The way my parents brought me up i have speech impediment (stutter and i cannot formulate sentences quickly and i struggle to talk), i get bullied and still laugh, get emotional scarred and people still expect me to smile. I only laugh and smile at school while i had friends, but since i graduated i have no friends and no one talks to me, except my parents who ostracise my very existence as a mistake everyday. Also during a biology class after receiving crappy marks in chemistry and getting scolded by my parents, i slit my wrist with a scalpel, my friends at the time took me to the nurse and i had some medicine/band-aid applied to my wrist, scared of what my parents will say to me i hid it, when i woke up, my band-aid was gone and i was sure they saw it since i live in a small apartment i sleep in the same room. Come morning it seemed as if they did not care or wanted to care about my injury. I wanted to kill myself since the age of 5, i prayed i would die everyday to relive my parents burden of having me, i was too afraid to end it myself, so I would hope i got into a freak accident or was killed, unfortunately nothing has happened yet.I go uni now and study software engineering, having received a atar of 77.85, which was a far cry from studying medicine. I want to make friends at uni but my speech impediment, how i look (I am not exactly what you call a good looking guy, i know I am ugly), but i still continue to falsely hope on. I skipped over alot of my past because it is better left unknown. I just turned 18 yesterday, i was hoping i would die before turning into a adult, kind of disappointed to be honest, woke up immediately scolded for looking sad, i only had 2 friends remember my birthday, 2 family friends and my parents obligated wishes. As time flew more and more people forgot about me, which is not bad because i always wanted to be forgotten i guess. When cutting the cake, the asked me to smile, but i would not since i was sad i was still alive. They started to curse me like always for not being thankful for what i have, they always like to monitor what i do so they check my phones and stuff. I have a younger sibling who is blessed, they receive everything from my parents i wish i had, whom i also stopped talking to after my parents routinely check on my email, where they discovered me and my friends joke round calling each other names and stuff. One of my friends called me gay as a joke, which my sister called me infront of all her friends who are in highschool too. The only person who i had close relations with made me feel betrayed for putting trust in them. My parents made me ""reconcile"" with them, which i acted as i did, but never felt that they were sincere (happened 2 years ago). I am trying to get my first job at retail so i leave the house more and can contribute money to the family and am not a leech, but no one is hiring since covid and i have no work experience. So i need to wait until covid bans are lifted if I am still alive lol.Now to today, my parents spoke to me again about how much of a disappointment i'am, i make myself numb to pain by holding back tears and looking pan face all the time, but i cried for the first time to them for the first time in 2 years despite them ""calling me out"" for different things, even them all wishing i was dead and if they had known i was going to be born they would have aborted me or calling me a mistake. My parents said they probably made a mistake when they received there baby from the nursery, which broke my heart. I act stone face to hide my tears and sadness, but i did not say anything back to them, because whenever i did i would make things worse for myself by expressing my feelings. Imagine ur friend consoling you despite being reluctant, when you finally get consoled, there pissed at you for taking forever and things get worse. Like that so i just be quiet and only nod my head or giving 1-2 word answers. They feel no remorse and continued to talk to me. Later on one of them comes and asks me why i cried saying they were surprised, i choose not to say anything so they lecture me for 1 hr 30mins asking why, telling me there hardships and how much of a failure i am. Here i am now on the verge of decided whether to jump of my apartment or not, I have written and signed a couple of draft notes on what i done to my body after i die (donated to medical research or organ transplants), removes more burdens of my parents. Idk what to do sorry for wasting your time, this is more of a rant if anything. Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english despite it being my first language. What do i do?",Suicidal

I am never happy, I am always miserable, I am always fucking bored, I lost all my social skills, i have 5 friends, my family does not even like being around me, my coworkers all know I am fucking insane and keep a distance from me, I work at a gas station because I feel too incompetent to do anything else lol cannot get lower than that, I had a physique like a young Hollywood teen actor until I allowed my depression to destroy it, now I am skinny fat, I always feel like a useless piece of shit degenerate loser, I have only been laid by three girls and all three of them just wanted to fuck me for my body, I have suicidal ideation running through my brain all day long, hell I even almost died last year from a suicidal overdose on a bottle of lamictal but thankfully I survived it and got locked in a nuthouse for my 5th time in a three year span, when I am not at work I lay in bed on my phone all day long, joy ride, take walks, stress eat, or go to the gym, and when I am there I deal with crippling social and performance anxiety and can barely lift for an hour. I am emotionless, cold, have repulsive thoughts, existential dread, have destroyed any opportunity I have ever had placed in front of me, feel like an outcast, etc etc etc. I tell my psychiatrist that I do not want to take my meds anymore, he gets nasty with me and tells me that he will not wean me off of them and if I want to stop taking my meds I am on my own.

If I decided to post this at the end it would not be from my original account because I think someone I know may identify me somehow. I just do not know what I am expecting from you by doing this. I just need to feel calm. I have this dire feeling of leaving society. For good. I just want to go far away. I feel like I cannot trust anyone in the world. In my fantasies I would like to meet a person(a man or a woman) who thinks and feels just like me. Hug him/her and cry until I do not have tears anymore. But I know it is just fantasy. do not know what I really want. My brain is battling over multiple thoughts at the same time. For short periods of time I feel happiness. For short periods of time I believe in real intimate human connections. Until very immediately I realize it is just fucking fake. I do not want to die. I think I am not suicidal. Onetime in life many years ago, I decided to die but I could not complete it right at the point. I was afraid of sth. I had hope that things can change over time. But so far it did not. Actually I think that if things have gotten worse. I wish things change soon for better. Because it is just painful now. This feeling is intolerable. Suffocating. I do not know how others do it. the 'normal people'. I cannot put together words to describe my feelings correctly. I am confused. I feel brain fogged. I want to go to the jungle...",Depression

I drink so much water I feel like a damn plant, So that is a plus. But the mental abuse I deal with along with everyone and everything letting me down is just a huge issue. I used to look forward to waking up and going about my day. And now I look forward to maybe one or two things in my life. I am stuck in a downward spiral and I do not see myself getting out of it anytime soon. I used to be such an incredibly happy person. Always tried to look on the brighter side of things. Now? Ha.

"I am 25F. I was diagnosed with depression at 12, and borderline personality disorder at 23. It comes and goes, but when its bad its BAD. Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment, but also not particularly bad, either. But i feel like I am in a serious slump.I have tried therapy multiple times in the last 13 years, multiple different therapists and approaches but it honestly has never done anything for me at all.I have been on SO many different medications throughout the years, and finally am on one that helps more than the others, but still not fully. Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders, so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps, so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid, and even with good insurance i was paying almost $300 out of pocket, twice a month, just for therapy alone, not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years, who is supportive and as helpful as he can be, but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself, he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general, and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her.

"It has become nearly impossible for me to relate to the normal things that other people have and take for granted everyday. I do not feel human anymore because I cannot relate to or connect with anything that people say anymore. All I see is everyone elee living their lives while I have been stuck in the same position for years with no help. Whenever I see a couple togerher it really effects me because I have never had anything like that and I realized that other people do not care what you are goinf through, as long as they feel good they are content to ignore you. I am almost 29 now and I have never been in a real relationship in my life. People have always treated me differently.

But since I do not have any money I can only have hobbies that are free such as writing and reading. It saddens me to no end how other people are held above us and used as a form of social capital. Its unreal how much those in power have completely ruined the natural interactions that humans used to have. Almost every single way that people interact these days is twisted and unnatural. Humans were never meant to live this way, but for some reason we continue to, day after day, much to our own dismay. Sometimes I feel this world is nothing but a nightmare when I think about the past and how people used to act. People were not always this way, but they act like there is no other alternative or other ways to live. All of these things going on within society and the interactions between us have caused my heart to become harder over the years. I used to be a sensitive person who felt a range of emotions and I used to be able to get excited about things. Now I feel like a broken person, I do not feel much anymore except extreme despair and sadness which eventually feels like nothing after a while.

"I moved to a new country and I came here with my close friend. The few people I knew here once I landed were her classmates and I did not click with them, I did not like their vibe, their overbearing nature, maybe I did not like that they were so extroverted. (My friend had the same thoughts about them but did not do anything because they were her classmates) And so naturally, it showed and they do not like me back, which did not affect me because they are not my friends and I do not interact with them in any part of my life. However, now it has gotten to a point where I have become a laughing stock in her group, they talk shit about me, make jokes on me, TO MY FRIEND and she laughs and agrees with them. My friend is known to be gullible, people have told her that, she knows it but it makes me extremely gutted that she feels the way she does. I also read messages where she told one of her friends that she is getting irritated by me. She told the same friend, who is also her fuck buddy, ""what if I turn into her? You tend to become the person you live with. If I did, would you still talk to me?"" and so on. we have just moved to this place, we had plans to explore this new country and do a lot of stuff but now that I have read about all of this, I do not know how to react. I do not want to confront her because I feel that is always backfired with me as I am not good with words when I am angry and I might say something irreversible plus it is going to make living together difficult and I have no plans/interest in moving out, we have had to struggle alot find this place.

"I already posted this on other subreddit but I got not answer, so here I go again: First of all, I want to say that I am a huge ignorant about depression and anxiety, plus my mind feels foggy so I cannot think straight at the moment.

The feeling comes and goes, Id say it happens around 4 or 5 times a month. But this last week just got worse, I really feel sad everyday, I feel a hole on my chest and I sob and cry uncontrollably. I believe I do not have a reason to be sad, I have honestly a great relationship with my husband, hes super supportive and hes always there for me.

"Recently my boyfriends ex threatened suicide and the wave of emotions that washed over me was almost too much. I grew up in a very abusive household where my sister and I were both physically beat and emotionally abused. I had the added bonus of being sexually abused. From a very young age we learned to fear our father and his moods. I can recall my mom attempting suicide multiple times when I was growing up. I can vividly remember seeing her in the shower with her clothes still on and my dad trying to get her to throw up.Ill never forget the nights my sister had to spend in the hospital after her attempt, she came very close to succeeding. My attempt was much more low key but it was there. Thank god my best friend told a school counselor, he literally saved my life. Of course therapy was never an option, we had to maintain the appearance of a happy family, no one could know what went on behind closed doors. I am not sure where I am going with this. All these images and memories keep popping up in my head. I thought I had dealt with the trauma that was my younger years already. I guess my therapist and I still have work to do.

"So this is a post that I have been meaning to make for a while. I suppose you could call this an adjustment disorder. I realize now that the career I so loved is not going to work out for me.And it is too late to reasonably switch.I have been looking at the balcony recently more and more. There are people working outside so it would not be a good time to make the move now. What do I tell my family? My friends? Do I just say goodbye? Tell them how much I appreciated their love and kindness? There are days where I have felt good recently, but it is fleeting. I have literally failed badly in the prior weeks due to this depression in my residency, effectively closing the door on a subspecialty I think I would have enjoyed. Now I am stuck - likely not going to get a job in an area or in a hospital that I will remotely enjoy. After a decade and a half of my life, 12-14 hour days and intense, emotional stress. This is it.I supposed I should be grateful. I do have a loving family. A loving girlfriend. My best friend lives in Vancouver, he checks in from time to time. My sister recently visited and it was very nice seeing her.I did a trial of therapy. She gave me breathing exercises and some CBT to help cope with these negative thoughts. However, at the end of the day, none of that is going to change the situation I am in. I could have had so much more. I will always think that in the back of my mind at work. I know this about myself. it is going to drive me crazy. I gave up so much to be where I am at today. I supposed this is a spoiled, comparative mindset that is truly unhealthy. I should be glad to be making a top income in the US. I have the ability to subspecialize and impact people's lives in a nice way. But I fucked up. Royally.This is not a goodbye. I know I will likely not end it today. But I will give it a few months, I do not see this lasting long for me. Probably not a good idea to post this to my main account so I will move this to my throwaway from years ago.Thanks for reading. I have not felt anything positive in a long time. Feels like there is a weight attached to my eyelids and it is hard to truly FEEL. I love my girlfriend, I love my family, my dog, my friends. I truly do. But I cannot feel it.

"I have no right to be depressed. Over the past decade, I have fixed my life, mostly. I went to college, got my degree, got a great job with fantastic co-workers... But that does not take away from the fact that I did in my 40s what I *should* have done in my 20s.I am looking back at a wasted life and seeing things that I will never achieve now. Getting married? Having kids? Pft... I did not do it in the past because I was not going to subject anybody to the immature shitshow that was my life, and I am not doing it now because I do not want to subject anybody to the immature depression that is my life. My meds are helping me to not break down crying on a regular basis, but they do not take away the hard truth that my life is almost over *and it was wasted*.Starting my life so late is also putting me in the wrong peer group. The friends that I had from high school until my mid-40s are no longer a part of my life. Right now, my very best friend is nearly half my age. All of my co-workers are also young Millennials. Some are even Gen Z. My belief structures are more Millennial than Gen X, as are my interests. I am currently watching Avatar and She-ra, for fucks' sake. :(Funny thing? I am not suicidal. I have a crippling fear of death. Non-existence just scares the hell out of me. I just want more time... Or to take back what I wasted. My co-workers accept me and include me in their social lives, but I cannot help but think that I am just some creepy old guy hanging out with kids... Kids in their mid-to-late 20s, but still.

"Hello. After having a quite long psychotic episode, I have been struggling with really bad depression. Even now when my meds do not naturally repress the ""happy"" processes in my brain, I still struggle a lot.

"I do not even know where to begin. I do not want to die but I do not want to be alive either. I have called and talked to someone on the suicide hotline twice this week. When she asked if I was suicidal I just started balling and crying saying I do not know. I know that people love me and I do not want to hurt anyone. I do not think I would actually act on anything. But its still difficult to have the constant battles in my head. Its hard to wake up and my chest hurts, then continues to be heavy for the rest of the day. I have been trying to distract my mind. Be around those that love me. But God its so hard. I just cannot help but think what if I feel like this forever? I read a thread about people who left suicide notes behind and just scrolled and cried. I do not even know what I am asking for by posting this. All I know is its hard to feel like this everyday Lonely",Suicidal
"Is been a while since i posted and left the things halfways. I explained how I was forced to quit from a well paying work and have been unable to recover economically since. I have severe trust issues now and have become very bitter and cynical. Last time I also told you about how i started wandering alone afterwork looking for troubles until i was finally assaulted and went so far as to goad my aggressor to pull the trigger on me. So I started therapy. I was still being somewhat supported by both my exs, one helped me find a place to stay and try to recover enough to find a job again and the other one lend me her shoulder and listened to me whenever she could, i was grateful for that. Then the therapist made me realize a few things. First of all that i was right to be depressed, my story was harsh, and she was amazed i went for so many years without looking for help. I told her that i already do things to stave off depressions since i sculpt, write and do digital art as a hobby, but lately that was not enough, i felt and i still feel like i do not get joy from it anymore. She suggested we started with telling her about myself, about my relation with my family, with my friends, etc. So it turned out that i was not only depressed but had repressed over 20 years of anger, since i always acted as a mediator or a problem solver, i barely ever let out my anger be shown. I have adandomnent issues because of a very traumatic episode that ocurred when i was five and is something that keeps on dragging with both my ex's leaving me at some point, although both cases were amiable enough i got hurt and moved on or tried to move on. This feels like senseless ramble, sorry. So i quited my job on the call center. I move cities again and had to stop seeing my therapist because of money being short. I started working at a winestore and i kept bashing my head against the boss's. He was an idiot. I also understood that i have a very difficult time working with people face to face. I am not only assertive but also quick to lash out against costumers and the boss if i feel atacked somehow. I left the place after a year, they did not fire me because even though all the fights, i was a good worker, and one of the few that did not quit after 2 weeks of work because of it being too hard. I left on my own volition after a discussion about the contract, and since i was a petty jerk y waited enough to time my quitting with the holydays, so bossman would have to cover my absence himself. Just after quitting, i got on a fight with a close friend, and my landlord decided to evict me just because. Actually i know the reason but since the place was offered by a ""friend"", i took it at something they would go ""backsies"" later on. Trust issues, man. Since i was getting evicted i stopped looking for a job, took my stuff and returned to my folks places, which does not make me happy. I was wanting to burn my savings on the therapy again but i felt bad about using money while not having a job, then covid came and jobs became more difficult to get. One of my ex's finally decided to push me into drawing lewds for commission. It was an old idea i never truly tried because I am not comfortable about it, is not something i like. But my regular art never got attention. With her help i created a super corny/girly/nonethreatening handler for deviant and off i went to draw shit for other people. She just asked me to never show her the stuff, and i could comply with that since i m not comfortable letting anyone else that i know see it, although close friends have been warned. I started to get some traffic, with it some commissions. I started saving money again, and thought of calling my therapist again to see how we could work into improving myself or my life, since i ve never stopped having suicidal thoughts. Then my ex let me know that she was having a hard time being there for me, she made me feel as a liability and cut contact with me completely. And i had a meltdown, she had been my closest friend through the whole ordeal and now she leaves. So instead of calling my therapist to improve myself, i tell her i feel miserable, wronged, sad, and still want to die. I want the pain to stop, I am more scared of keep hurting than of died, a week before a roof almost fell over me and i did not even react. I am numb to that, but i do not like hurting I am tired of that. I am tired of this, so why should i drag this on? And now I also understand that I feel emotionally alone, and even if a stop feeling hurt, that will not change easily. TLDR: random rant and followup to last post. My world just got smaller (follow up)",Suicidal
"I have had severe seasonal depression over the last three years and this year- this winter it did not appear, so I thought that I beat it. But last week I had a feeling that reminded me of the nightmare that I thought was over. And it came back 10x stronger. I was completely fine. Even adderall was not able to help or clear my mind of this fog. I am really really afraid, because this time I will not be able to fight it or to wait for it to clear. I just need hope, i want to go back,not everyting was perfect before, but this complete ego death, no self worth, weakness, brain fog is just unbearable. Also, I am still using my meds as I was in the depressed state: zoloft, adderall(very low dose) and quetiapine(also low) Please tell me it is not comming back",Depression
Soo umm i am a 15 year old studying in 11th (I know its pretty young) and was wondering what to do..I actually am pretty confused what to do I am not afraid to die but even if i die someday i wish it to be quick. After surfing through internet and much more I came to a realization that only studies matter in this world..If you cannot study your life can never be secure and you will face hardships. The constant nagging from parents to study and them always pointing out faults criticising us...(My parents are actually good it is just that on studies things happen.. they do not beat me but those petty fights and unknowingly pressurising me)I many a times get lecture from them about how important is future and why i need to work hard for the upcoming years. The fact is that i know it pretty well but i cannot find the motivation in doing it.. I love my family a lot it is just that( I am sorry its very complicated to explain) I do not even know why i am writing this post. I am just unsure what to do I do not want to commit suicide or anything as i know it will devastate the family and i also have a little brother whose life i do not want to ruin by dying I change topics very quickly as you can see by reading this post Its just like i do not know my true feelings..my true selfI am not able to concentrate right now and just umm never mindmy mind is going wobble Uncertain About Life,Suicidal
"So many people post here. you are lucky if you get more than one comment. A lot of the time people just upvote and do not even say anything and that is if your post is popular. Normal posts have the opposite problem. Maybe a few comments but no upvotes. Oh well. I do not know maybe this post is stupid. I am probably wrong, I usually am. I just know that every time I come here, because I want to be with people that get it, I end up disappointed. And its ironic. Because this community is here so that we do not feel alone. But it honestly never helps me. Yet I come back. Either to leave a comment, to reach out to someone I relate to, or to a make a post that I delete immediately. All of which pretty much leads to more nothing. More loneliness. So yeah I just had to say that. And obviously none of you guys will even see this. But I hope that whoever does has an okay day. I am still trying to learn to celebrate the ok days, myself. Because those are my new good days now. I do not have good days anymore, but that is okay. I am trying to get by without doing anything to hurt myself or the people around me. If I manage to do that, then my day was okay and that is good.

"there is a plethora of ways I could kill myself at this moment, many of which would be pretty painless. Or at least, I would not be in the right mind to feel the pain if I were to commit.But I cannot do it.Is it fear? Is it that I still want to live? Nothing actually seems particularly wrong with my life, so is it just a phase? Am I trying to be edgy? I do not know. I am not even focusing on what the title of the post says, I just wanted to write something.Also just realized that I might have imposter syndrome, which is fun.I feel like I am just fucking things up for myself despite having everything I need around me. I feel like I do not deserve to contemplate suicide because other people have gone through actual, real pain. I am at a time where I should be finding focus, where I should be giving it my all, but everything I have done up until this point feels pointless and I feel I will never achieve what I want even if I tried now. I hate myself making things so much harder than it needs to be. And I hate myself for not even trying to make it better for myself. Can this even be called being suicidal? I do not know. I might be overreacting. But at the same time I want to die. I do not want to turn 18. But I am turning 18 soon and I do not know if I want to just end it before I have to face becoming an adult or if I should try to survive by then because I know that there is still a chance to improve. This is just a full on rant, no one's going to read this. I want to talk to someone, but I do not know if I can trust them. I am afraid to find out what would happen if people knew that I have these thoughts. Would my friends and family still love me? Would they see me differently? Where do we go when we die? Do we get reborn when we die? If I were to die, would ""I"" ever feel the sensation of having control over body and thought again? Is it worth finding out? Should I try now? Or would it just be endless nothingness forever for me? it is fucking cold. I have a hoodie on, but my body feels like there is chills all over it. I do not know who I am anymore. I spent my whole life buried in textbooks and nothing else and now I am crumbling under the expectation that I have to apply for uni, whether they will even accept me, why I did not do anything in the past few fucking months I had to do something about this worry. I am scared I am going to disappoint everyone, because I know I made them all believe in me. But now I feel like I am going to betray them by either fucking things up for myself or just ending it all. I do not want to sleep, and I do not want to wake up. I do not want to fail, but I just want to end it all. Who decided that life had to be this confusing? Who decided to give me this fucking brain that thinks these thoughts? I am scared to find out if I would actually kill myself before my birthday. it is only a little bit away. I do not want to put that burden on my family. I know that they love me. I love them. I am fortunate enough to have them around when I cry, so I do not know why I am even having these thoughts. I do not deserve to be like this. I wish I spent my time doing at least something else. Maybe then I would have a better idea of what life is about. Of whether or not my worries are even important. Whether I deserve to cry.This was a long rant. I doubt that one can even form a reply to this. I just wish I could pick something and stick to it - either try and give it my all or decide to end it all now.

"I will not be able to experience what normal people do, yet I get to suffer a thousand times more. Every day. I waste my life knowing I waste it and I will not get this dream life I thought my life was going to be like the first 26 years I spent on this life.I am currently 27, about to hit 28 and I found out last September right before I was going to turn 27 that I had a mild autism. 5 years prior to that I got epilepsy and I have been isolated from severe social anxiety and depression since 2011, which is the year I was diagnosed with ADD. While born with a stutter.I grew up thinking only my stutter was the only thing holding me back yet I felt like a fucking freak. A mistake of nature. But that I was going to at least satisfy my interest in cars by driving them, have me &amp; my friends journey life together, go to parties, live my teens like a teen, have girlfriends, have a job and not have anything stand in my way apart from a bit of a bump in my speech. But that was not the case. At all. I have always been this very mute, socially awkward guy everybody is scared of. Until they talk to me and find out I am not that bad. But with my inability to read so much socially I have to rely on others to start the conversation.This autism answers many questions. There are a lot of things I do not understand with this world when it comes to the social stuff. it is just so damn frustrating, because even if I want to be social and have friends I just do not fucking know how to do it. I am so out of touch with so much on the internet despite fucking being isolated on it for 10 fucking years. Been so damn scared of social stuff that I have just played singleplayer games and watched a few youtube channels over and over and over because discovering stuff is also so damn... scary somehow. Everything just falls down and confuses me. Fucking everything. I get the impressions and how you should think to crash with each other. To name a few, you should not be mainstream while being against mainstream is considered bad. do not be casual and to be hardcore can sometimes be cringey. I am just so confused so when I pick on youtube channels, music artists and such I pick from groups of people I follow that I think are not mainstream/casual and not edgy but in the middle and go from who they know. And how people find these in the middle or edgy people are so confusing to me. Same with everything ""internet""/meme. Always wondered that. I feel so outside, so lacking in everything. And in these 10 years I have made so much progress outside with my social anxiety but I keep failing and making it the other way when it comes to online. Multiplayer games are pretty much impossible.

Before meds I would have bad days and good days with most days being a mix but on meds it just seems to dull the highs and the lows and I am just in a consistently low state.

I went from things having little satisfaction to them nearly having none, it made me cut some bad habits but I have no motivation for anything now. I lost interest in music, video games, social media and more. On meds I just lay in bed and maybe watch a movie at best to pass the time waiting for the depressive period to pass but on the meds it never actually does pass. it is obvious I have some form of imbalance but the meds have such a profound effect on me and change me on such a fundamental level. They change some things for the better and others for the worse but ultimately it is just different, not better. I have tried sertaline, fluoxetine, venlafaxine.

I feel like I cannot communicate with anyone and I do not know if I have undiagnosed autism or if I am just so socially anxious at this point after the last relationship I had (6+ years ago) called me a rapist and got me socially outcast by entire school (including the faculty) meaning they withdrew my mental health treatment and let me drown in my studies and blamed me for not pulling myself together but if I get angry at her I am violent so I definitely did it and if I do not then it must be true because no sane person would be okay with being called that. I had two guys try and beat on me as I was ordering drinks at my local for being a weird rapist freak and now I am banned for life for retaliating and everyone that was there definitely thinks its true. So I ran, I am in Spain, and the anxiety followed me, and no one understands me (small town, 70% English, everyone speaks it) and I feel like people interpret any confidence as arrogance and my sorrow as pity seeking and I do not even know if my family believe me when I tell them it is not true. I tried anti anxiety medication but the UK crisis team are now adamant I am a junkie after I said the medication was not working and I needed something stronger, and the first batch they gave me ran out 3 weeks ago and I cannot get more because private health care is more than I can afford and I cannot keep nipping back to the UK like the flights will not cost me 150 especially after my work halfed my wages because I have been signed off for 4 months and they probably think I am just calling it in to get more out of them and I know that is not even everything because in amongst all of it I became a shitty person and have real deep regrets about pain and scars I have left people with because I could not deal with my own shit and its all so overwhelming and I cannot get anything together or talk about it with anyone because the best I can do is a stupid rollercoaster word salad that is wildly out of chronological order like this and I just want to press reset but that does not exist so maybe I should just follow the light Webbed",Suicidal

I am doing all the right things. I have been reaching out for help since I was a teen, begging my parents to let me see a doctor and get some medicine. I am in good shape. I exercise. I eat mostly well. I have friends. I am in decent overall health. I have got a stable life. I have got an objectively great job, some family, a few good friends, finances are okay, can afford to buy and do things I want. I have never done drugs, not even so much as vaped or smoked a cigarette, I do not drink But here I am, every step along the way, at my doctors and counselors doors begging for help.

I am trying it. And I am not gaining any sort of ground. I can only wake up and bullshit pat myself on the back of doing the bare minimum of making it through another day so many times that it just feels pathetic. And exhausting. I am just so exhausted.

At what point do we admit that some people just cannot be helped? Either they are too far gone or its just not in the cards for them?I do not want to admit that about myself, but I cannot ignore brazen fact. I just do not think I am cut out for life. And the ONLY thing, and I do mean **ONLY** thing, keeping me from taking my life is the pain I would feel during it. Everything else I have already come to grips with. Making mom sad? Leaving my cats? Making a mess for the police to clean up? Etc. I have accepted all of that. I just literally cannot do this.

All my friends have been treating me like shit for so long but they never used to, and I gained some self respect and now they are all turning on me. They kept on fucking up my life and making me feel like shit especially the last few months. I get blamed for other peoples wrong doings and they get away with it and then chat shit about saying how much of a dick I am even though they all bitch about each other. Whenever I try do the right thing, it goes wrong all the time. The more I try to get away from them the more they claw their way back into my life. I cannot escape. I thought starting therapy this year would be good but all its done has taken away my emotion less state, made me even more depressed and made me realise how much my family has fucked me up since day one.

"This is going to be a long (and not first) post on this subreddit.I am a 22 year old man, and even though I do not like it either when these posts start with a list of things people do not like about themselves (they suffer from eucharist syndrome I am going to), I believe these are in relation with my problems. I am gay, autistic, virgin, pursuing a useless degree (we will return to this), no driving lisence, barely any money under on my name, and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion, drive (or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b) in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school (they wanted me to mingle with other ""elite"" kids) which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life (crying and begging my parents not to make me go there, can you guess wheter they listened?) I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle, to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life, regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so, demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics, drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough, I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here, sheltering, sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything, but wierdly enough people see me as ""normal-acting"" (sic!) I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods, each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever, positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TL;DR: Years of abandonment, avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is self-fulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS.: There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine, but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant.

"I did not realize it, what kept me grounded for so long and able to operate efficiently.Ends up being my lil bro. We are 4 years apart, different in everyday, polarizing. I love this kid with all my heart and I want him to do well for himself. So why is it that when he tells me he is going to move across the country, my will to live dissipates? I am not here to tell you my life story, as its not important. There are many of us who deal with this plaque in our minds, and I cannot help but wonder if this is some cruel way of self defense. I feel way too strongly on all fronts, I am incapable of of emotions that are small, its 0 or 10000 at all times. Into adulthood I have told myself I have made progress, with my behavior. My main coping mechanism with life is to learn about it, I decided at some point in my earlier youth that this is how I am going to solve my internal issues, with knowledge. Turns out knowledge is power but what was failed to mention is that not everyone can handle that power. I can now explain why on a chemical and biological level, I feel the way I do, and it only makes things worse nowadays. I have tried to take on a hedonistic mindset to circumvent the already dark thoughts with the peace that well its all essentially pointless.. but I am not a hedonist, and as much as I say I *do not* care I really do care at the umpteenth power.

When you do not feel comfortable enough to speak about your thoughts because the people who are supposedly there for you, cannot be bothered- and its not their fault.

Today I filled my mouth with my anti depressants just could not swallow them. Is there even a point of trying to live anymore? Does it actually get better? I truly do not want to be alive anymore I hate every second of it everyday I wake up in so much emotional pain. Faking a smile becomes harder and harder I do not know how much longer I can take Suicide and depression,Suicidal
I cannot escape my thoughts or the reality I created when people talk I do not even hear them my thoughts take overI pushed a bit away who loved meI am fucking done tuck this shitI used to be spiritual but I hope its a sleep a dark sleep forever this cannot follow mw No,Suicidal
I am 34 years old it is sad that i have to joke about depression like crack a joke instead of telling how i really feel. I am screaming inside i lost my dad last year and it was a hard awakening we think our parents are invincible obviously not.. I miss him terribly and i just lost the only person that really gets me she is left me no explanation just gone now she was my rock. I force myself to get up everyday go to work and get through it just to come home to an empty apt no one to greet me just darkness and silence. I am thankful i have my mom she listens to me and her advice is taken whole heartedly. But i cannot fully express myself to her she worries about my happiness she wants me to be happy before she is gone so i tell her i am happy but deep down I am a mess idk i may be just ranting or whatever but I am getting to the point where the fake smiles the masks i wear to hide my feelings are not enough i just want someone to see that I am trying I am trying I am trying but no one ever does I have always been the one that listens and tries to help anyway i can. Idk what to do anymore No title,Depression

"Hi everyone, this is my first post here and I am just feeling so tired and unmotivated. I do not even feel like going to my therapist anymore. I feel pathetic saying its too much effort because its literally over zoom but its just too much. I do not feel like talking about my problems anymore. I just feel like forgetting about them. she is a lovely therapist, but I just do not want to deal with this anymore. I just feel so sad lately its almost becoming to the point of numbness. Luckily I do not live with my parents anymore so they do not physically notice. I barely shower anymore unless I have to. I hate brushing my teeth, my room and bathroom are disgusting, I cannot even find the motivation to make myself food anymore. I am in so much debt right now, and my boss was talking to me about getting a promotion at work and then she just went over and handed it to someone else. I just want to disappear. Not even necessarily wanting to die, but I just want to be gone and not have to deal with my life anymore. Just so tired",Depression
"No matter how hard I try to turn my life around, I lose. Dissapointment is all I have ever felt. I am so close to just giving up on this living thing, Will things ever get better? I need someone to tell my I have to live right now.",Depression
"Feeling less motivated by the day. Use to heavily train at gym almost everyday, now thought of putting myself through all that taxing work makes me groan internally. do not like looking in mirror despite being objectively good looking/hot, or taking time to self analyze. Feel lazy and just want to smoke weed and do nothing. have not had a relationship in 7 years since fucking middle school, have not gotten laid in a year, have more fingers on 1 hand than I do friends.And the hate for myself is growing every single day. I may have people around that want to help but I would never and will never confide to them. They will never understand what I am going through or why. I think depression is upon me",Depression
I am at the end of my rope and cannot stop crying. I asked for help and was pushed away because he thinks I am faking it. Or he does not want to be bothered with me. I am going to my doctor tomorrow. that is the earliest I can get an appointment. I am sure she will just prescribe antidepressants. I have been on every brand of antidepressants and they do not work. I think I just need someone to talk to who can be a friend and not my therapist. Someone who will care. Someone who will sit with me and hold my hand in the darkness. But when I yell out for help there is only an echo. I almost ended it all on Sunday. I do not know why I stopped. I should have just finished the Job right there and then. Echo,Suicidal
I do not want to tell about this to my family or friends because of the negative thoughts that I have sometimes (I am not much of a talker anyways). Depressed (again),Depression
"I am not trying to make some edgy post about how I want to do drugs and shit but I do not think its something you can say without coming across like that so whatever. But I do not know, I just want to do heroin really badly right now. I guess I am just sick of feeling so shitty and I am sick of nothing working to make it better. All the medications I have been on have done sweet fuck all and I have been through dozens at this point. Therapy has not helped me at all and I just feel awful all the time. I feel like I do not belong in the world at all and yet I am forced to exist in it. So I keep cycling between two thoughts constantly, that I want to kill myself or that I want to do heroin. I do not know why, but I really, REALLY want to try heroin",Depression
I feel like killing myself. just had one of the worst days of my life,Depression
"Well guys, I need some help. Like I am seeing a licensed therapist, but thru talkspace as I cannot afford any therapy in my town...and I do not have a car due to anxiety. Well, this therapist is new to me, but before I came to her I was looking into short term disability. And before, I thought that maybe I could just tough it out. I am one to kind of push on through. I think that because of my flair for the dramatics, I do tend to downplay and gaslight the fuck out of myself when I am depressed. When I lost a job opportunity it got bad. I relapsed and started SH again. Which is something I do not like about myself. I was clean for about three months, but lately my job has been really hard on me. We started with 50 workers in my position, there are now 8 left....only 7 months later. I have even gone as far as nearly getting into an accident as a passenger, and being disappointed I came out unscathed. I wished something would happen. I do not enjoy weekends because I know I am going back. And the people I speak with are lovely, but I am incapable of thinking straight and you know when you are just getting BAD again. And I have no idea what I am supposed to do. My therapist said I would qualify, I have to talk to my pcp about it, but I feel so guilty. Everytime I get on the phone to talk to someone about it, I burst into tears. it is so humiliating to know they have got me crying for an hour recorded begging them to just ""Bear with me, I never do this. I am so sorry, I do not know why I am crying!"" I just need help. How did you get the STD approved? What should I expect? Please, please, no negativity. Taking a leave at 23, when I am otherwise in good health, is truthfully so humiliating and saddening. I feel bad enough. Claiming Short Term Disability for work. TW - SH, suicidal ideation",Depression
"My GF suffers from bad depression. She had become very distant and to me it felt like she was pushing me away. She started a new job and went really quiet. I took it as she had lost interest in me and I broke up with her. She could not seem to make time for me and I left for a trip and we had very little contact after I left. It seemed to me that she had no interest in having a conversation with me. She said that she thought I needed space, but idk why she would of thought that. She had became distant months ago and became more so as time passed. I am curious to know if this could be normal behavior of someone who is feeling overwhelmed and is moving through depression. All I wanted was to be there for her and to feel that she still cared. Once it felt like she did not care anymore, I could not do it any longer. I was very patient with her and would let her initiate any plans to hang out My GF was moving through a bad time of depression",Depression
"I cannot get a job, I keep fucking shit up, I feel like I am I cannot do anything, my meds work even less, I am stuck with so many urges that i am literally the definition of addiction, I cannot cope, I do not know how long I am about to be here, either Ill just run out of energy to even off myself or Ill just do it, its a 50/50, like most of my life Ill probably half ass it like the times before and mess it up, I am sick to my stomach of the ways I fuck EVERYTHING UP.

"I have had chronic ideations my whole life so this is nothing new but I thought Id finally gotten to a financial place where I could find someone to talk to. My husband gets annoyed when I ask for help, I work from home, we only have 1 car and all my friends/people who give a single shit about me are hours and hours away. Bit isolated. I am tired. there is no out. There will never be. I cannot keep asking my friends to listen to me complain about the same shit over and over, they have their own shit that is more important. I do not want to work 2 jobs and do all the cooking and housework but that is just my life. Husband has a spending problem so I am looking to pick up a third job after he quits his (I support this, he was a kind man until he started this job) so I do not have to go back to noodles once a day as sustenance and selling anything of any value. Although I do not think I own anything that cost more than $50 at this point. Maybe job 3 will be what does me in. Girl can hope. I am sorry, Ill probably get rid of this soon, its not like I can be helped. that small hit in my finances did a lot of damage and I have no one I can talk to so I hoped getting it out, even just somewhere would relieve a little bit of the tension in my brain. Was so close to being able to go to a therapist",Suicidal
i just cut myself deep enough to actually see fat and i freaked out for a second. is this what life is going to be like forever? just trying to get deeper and deeper until I am done being? fighting until there is no fight left in me? I am exhausted I am tired,Suicidal
"As the title says I am feeling so lost, it happens every so often maybe every few months or so. Like I just loose all motivation and it feels like I am in a state of trance and I just cannot bring myself out of it. I cannot feel joy and gets overwhelmed with the feeling of boredom. I starts to cry randomly even if I do not think of anything. it is just the worst feeling in the world to me. No doubt anyone will read this and that is fine it was just me thinking out loud and kind of hoping it would make more sense if I write it down, maybe help pull myself out of it or something. It did not really so I will just drink and wait it out I guess. Feeling so Lost",Depression
"My family has such high expectations. They expect me to work three minimum wage jobs because that is what ""adults do"". I did not ask to be born. I did not ask to grow up in this world where I basically have to work in order to survive. I have one job. it is not like I am a bum but whenever I am not a work, it is a problem. Whenever I have free time, it is a problem because to them I could be doing something better in my free time. I always get compared to others. I always get told I am not normal and that I am weird for just staying home and relaxing on my days off instead of picking up more jobs. I work 40 hours. What the hell do they expect? If this is adulting, I do not want any part of it. it is bad enough I am depressed and find it hard to get out of bed. I cannot imagine just working all the time when half the time I think of ending it. I will never be good enough. I did not ask to be born.",Suicidal
"I do not know what else to say I am on the verge of something terrible. I hate my life, I hate school I hate the stupid little things that set me off. I wish I would just kill myself and stop the horrors of my mind from constantly chasing me. I feel like I am cornered right now. I want to fucking kill myself so bad please I do not know what to do anymore I want to die I want to die I want to die i want to die why does no one ever seem to care I want do die so bad right now",Suicidal
"it is been years I have been dealing with anxiety, depression, Ocd and what not but everytime I have some big fight with my parents i feel its the breaking point and I am surely going to attempt to kill myself again. They have issue with everything I do, how I behave, how I look. I try my best but in their eyes I am nothing but a disappointment and failure which should not have existed in the first place. Yes they have said it to my face especially my mom. She is dealing with her own health issues because of which she tends to breakdown as well but there is a limit to talking shit about your kid. I never mentioned any of my relationships to my mother but she was very open about it so I mentioned about the girl I like now and she straight up demotivated me to the ground by saying I am not good enough for her, I am unattractive and what not, and honestly at this point if someone hands me a cyanide pill I would happily take it and end it once for all. I already hate myself and her talking shit to me just makes it worse more and more because I loved her the most in the entire world. Just because I am not capable of showing or expressing it does not mean I take her for granted. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up or OD on some sleeping pills and painkillers I hate myself and everyone around me",Suicidal
"I am so tired of trying at this point, everything is boring, everything is monotonous and i feel worse than i ever felt. I have friends and people that worry about me, i broke up with my boyfriend and he understood and support me to this day but why cannot i just enjoy things ? not even all the love of support of them can full the void that i have.i had a lot of hobbies, i tried different mindset, i did sports, i did exercise and nothing works.every day that i wake up i just wish i have the strength to even leave my bed and do something. And I am not even sad I am just bored, bored of being here, bored of trying to get better just to get even worse in one random day.i had a lot of suicidal thoughts and these days they are getting worse should i do it ? should i just ended it all ? idk, I am not scared to do it is just like is it worth it ? is not that i hate being alive it is just so... boring.i guess i just cannot enjoy living. I am so done",Suicidal
"So, something amazing happened yesterday! A job opportunity basically just sprang up into my face. I completed two back to back phone interviews with the owner and manager, then boy the next thing i know we are talking about start dates and pay and...I am terrified? I should be thrilled. How lucky am I that this happened? I should be jumping for joy because I desperately need a job, have not worked in a year due to covid, and this could be a great fit for me. But all i keep coming back to is how much I want to die. How anxious at failing i am. How depressed i am. How incapable I am. How I have walked this road before; gotten a cool job, dealt with the stress for a few days, and then broke under the weight of constant suicidal ideation. Its a pattern I, and the others in my life recognize. To the point that everyone I tell when getting the news mentions that ""oh well I am sure you can handle it this time"" This time...But I am so afraid. I am so depressed. I just want to close my eyes and never open them again. But i know i need this job. Please. Help... Self sabotage, please help",Suicidal
"I met a guy from Tinder three months ago and I like him a lot. He says he feels the same, but he does not show it. Were both in our late twenties and both want a serious relationship. He confessed he was feeling depressed and that is why we never see each other (5 or 6 times within 3 months), why he takes hours to answer messages while always online, why he is not more involved in the relationship. He was not like that at the beginning, and I am not sure if he was already feeling down at that time or not. I have been having difficulties trusting people (because of one past relationship) and I am not sure I believe him 100%, although I really want to. I also really want to keep him in my life and start getting more serious. How can I support him, especially so early in the relationship and considering the fact that he cannot give me the relationship I want? He says he cannot offer me consistency, that he could make it work one day and lack desire to do so the next. I have no idea what to do and how to do it. Helping my depressed date",Depression
"I have been through too much shit to list, but the most important thing is I have binge eating disorder (had numerous inpatient stays, seeing therapy 2x per week currently, zero changes) that has gained me 70 pounds which makes me want to kill myself, and I feel zero pleasure from literally anything and have not for years. I used heroin for 20 days straight (no longer using) to get my time without a binge tracker to 20 days, and now today less than a week later even though just two hours ago I was convinced binge eating was a thing of the past I binged. This means no leaving my room, interacting etc for a week at least, and I have two very important family things I am canceling in a few minutes. Eating disorders are terminal illnesses",Depression
"My parents hate each other.This girl I thought might have been the one left.I moved to another city just to see this girl, she still did not see me for 3 months and then we broke up.My parents moved here too. Now they are getting separated and my Mom is going back to her brother's place. My father is abusive and lost in his life, blames her for everything. What I do not get is, why am I cornered like this. Nothing is going rightI stay demotivated and do not perform as well as I can in college. When I try to, something like this happens.We have a dog, Hana. My mother is everything to Hana. Idk what she would do if my mother goes away. My father does not take care of Hana that often. My mother loves Hana and she is probably the only one Hana loves that much. Idk what Hana would do. My mother is nearing 50 idk how she is supposed to live alone. Fuck this. I honestly do not know what I would do if this actually happens. Is it possible that sometimes life is not supposed to be good ? You keep expecting it to be and one day you just die. You cannot even control the things that are making it worse. what is the point ? Nothing is going right in my life. I am stuck.",Depression
"i have been feeling intense physical symptoms because of depression. i cannot tell if gravity has gotten stronger or if my body just got heavier. also i feel dizzy and i am dissociating most of the time i am awake. i am very lonely most days and when i am not i am with people who make me feel way worse (most of them, the only one that does not i am not close to). I am not accident yet but i have been through a lot of shit and all the trauma has rendered me useless. i feel pathetic and i had my fair share of near death experiences in the past but i think i want to try again, i consider it everyday but some days it is way more desirable. I am sure no one would care. my life is falling apart and i have no one to trust through anything so what is the point. people generally dislike me because i am socially inept (i do not try to be rude and i do not think i am but i have a hard time communicating with people because of anxiety), and I am ugly. there are too many things i wish i could do but i cannot because i have limited resources and energy for that matter. yet at the same time i have no real goal in life anymore. i think i did at one point but the more i go through the less i care. i have intense paranoia because my parents in the past have invaded my privacy alot so i only have reddit. the paranoia is killing me and i feel like i cannot do anything without precautions. i could keep going for ages about the pathetic state of my life but there is always going to be something is that are unsaid so there is no point. idk. i just want to start planning again on ending it all because nothing is working. feeling gross and miserable, cannot think of a better title.",Suicidal

"Hello everyone,I am considering starting psychotherapy (again). I have received psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 3.5 years but it helped up to a point as its main goal is to make the client realize and be conscious of mental patterns and act on them. I am looking for new ways to heal myself. Basically, even if there is nothing going on, I feel constant anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain. I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus, to me, there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However, my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish, anxiety, and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harm/hurt me (due to survival instincts; for instance, in business or for money). This also causes my anxiety. &amp;#x200B;I appreciate any thought, idea, and help. Thank you :) How can I overcome my feelings of anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain?",Depression

Idk how much time I do not have much money, as I do not even work anymore, but I really needed help and wanted to get help so I payed for a private psychologist ! it is been 10 sessions now, and they sended an email to my psychiatrist (that I have got from the public system after trying to die) saying that they transfert my case to her... It took 10 sessions and 1500$ from me for that, and all that time that I thought I was getting help wasted... This money was precious, money give me a lot of anxiety !

"Fuck this world, fuck 99% of the people in it, let us hope everything burns and falls apart because this bullshit notion that there is kindness and quality is absolute horseshit.I am tired of people say, be kind and the universe will reciprocate; none of that is true, you have to be a terrible person who does terrible things in order to get ahead. Forget about being a quality human being, there never was such a thing. People need to start doing negative actions in order to rectify all the wrongs going on. You are not in control of anything and instead are just a pawn in a bullshit mirage of happiness. There is no point in helping anyone, there is no point in doing anything positive except for animals who cannot help themselves. People are fucking disgusting and I have zero empathy or sympathy for any being anymore. Millions suffer from depression and sadness and nothing is changing. In order to change anything, be a nasty person and take what you can, because that is how happy people live. Be evil, like a Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates, lie about having a good exterior and ravage everything you can because nothing good comes from being a good person. Drop the anxiety, ravage what you can, this place is a dump for anger and terror. The time for empathy is gone, fuck this world and fuck anyone who says you have to fight for goodness. There is no goodness, only shit people saying shitty things. Fuck money, fuck owning a home, fuck going to the movies, fuck listening to music, fuck an education, fuck helpless people because there is no helping them.

what is the point of continuing a mundane life if every fucking day is thr same I am so tired and so so so bored. I am not suicidal because I am sad I am suicidal because i do not see the point and no matter what i do i will never make an impact mo matter what i do. therapy does not work my meds do not work I am just stuck in an endless cycle of hopelessness. its so hard to enjoy the things i used to enjoy. all i have are my stupid hyperfixations and they will be gone one day too. i just feel like everyone else would be better off if i disappear off of the face of the earth. i only ever make people worse versions of themselves and i treat people so horribly. i just feel like i was put on this earth to suffer and because suffering I am so sick i just want it to stop i hate it here I am so bored of living,Suicidal

I have been doing better mentally lately but I am still in this regressive fragile state and my brain feels like mush after everything I have been through the past few years. I just feel like shit about where i am in life and sometimes i feel like there is no hope that it will get better. I get so anxious about being an adult and having to step up and take care of myself I am paralyzed by fear. I feel so held back and it sucks to see other people outgrow you and live your dream. I feel like such a failure and a loser no matter how much reassurance i get.

"They do not understand I am depressed, that I have been experiencing low moods because I had a traumatic experience.

I do not want to walk around and be known for having mental health issues and a degree, again not because I do not to have one, but because mental health is very stigmatized and looked down upon where I am.The thing here is that I want to go to a psychiatrist secretly in the near future but my mother keeps pestering me what is wrong, talk to me, etc. etc. I honestly believed her which is a dumb move to be honest so I opened up to her because you know, I want to ease her mind and at the same time, I want to let her see what I see. The former option was checked on her checklist but not the latter option. She saw what I see but she did not understand, but instead she used it to increase her pride or ego, told people without my consent, I honestly believed (and it should be) that if there is anything private, you should be honored that you out of all people are the one they tell it to so you do not say it and also take pride on it that way friendship is formed, tell to my father, whom I hate for reasons I am not telling, and tell to everyone who is not at all understanding.

I have been with this company for almost a year and it is no secret that I am incompetent and disengaged.

"I do not think it matters what I do but I will never matter to anyone. All I am good for is to pay bills and work... My spouse took me to this place he would been raving about, he had taken my daughter a few weeks back. We went and he acted nervous or like he was waiting for someone or maybe he was just embarrassed to be seen with me. Thinking back he walked behind me or not near me the entire time. Then yesterday while I was working he went back again. What bothers me more is he, who does not even like Chinese, kept pushing how he would go there to get ME food. I was not asking for it, I did not care what food was purchased. I felt manipulated but also was in the middle of work an it did not seem like the time to pry. I do not want to stop him from being happy either. It feels very manipulative to me. When he came back he was happy an ate and went back to sleep. He spent the rest of the evening on his phone till I went to sleep then ""had trouble sleeping"" and stayed up all night. This has become a cycle, apparently he only gets good sleep when I am awake. I keep thinking he is going to leave since last fall. Everyday I am prepared for him to tell me how he does not love me, that he never did. Every time he takes me somewhere public, as I push my cart I think is now when he is going to drop the ""It is whatever you want"" statement with 'because I am leaving you"". He has started saying the it is whatever you want,, what makes you happy, ect. These phrases combined with the fact that he will not even come near me. I have been here before... I am trying to get more hours at work and you know accept it. He looks disgusted when he looks at me, he does not want to be anywhere near me and there is no amount of putting lipstick on this pig to change it. My parents could not love me.

I am mad that they have no financial troubles and can afford living and studying overseas for years when it was already hard for my parents to sustain my studies in my own country.

I only ever talk to 4 people, which I do not have a problem with at all, but despite having these people in my life, I feel so alone in this world.

"I am an extremely introverted homosexual boy of 18 living in an extremely homophobic, judgemental society where gays are subjected to be killed if they ever come out, so I basically have no future other than living a lie in fear, hiding my feelings forever and never getting to love in my entire life. I used to be a very bright student who scored all A grades during my secondary education but ever since I started my high school, my grades have been drastically dropping because I am depressed all the time. I come from a big family with a history of bright minds and all my cousins, siblings and peers are all extremely well performing, meanwhile I am being a disgrace to my family. The pressure on me is immeasurable. I basically have no other talents, I have a weak, skinny body and I am not at all good at any sports either. In my attempts to search for something I am good at and as an attempt to hide my sexuality, I started going for basket-ball practice with some boys (because I found the game compelling), but only felt a burden to them and the only one who did not show any improvement in months, so I quit it. I do not even know what my career would be and what to try for even if I considered to live an unmarried life (which is again risky because I will be constantly judged). My social life is also non existent because I have just 2-3 friends who I talk to, and not one of them is close enough for me to share any of these with. I tend to distant everyone because I fear they will know my truth. I am also very insecure about my looks and my body so I have ceased to go out whatsoever unless necessary. I was also bullied back then at my hometown for having a feminine attitude until I got extremely sick and my family had to move to the city for better treatment for me, and ever since I have refused to return to my hometown even for a vacation. That said, I am also a sick person with a weak immune system and my family pays too much for my health care, for my studies etc and I do not think any of it is worth it. I also recently did a huge mistake, which is dating a girl who confessed to me, as an opportunity to change/hide my sexuality or in case someone is suspecting I was gay, only to hurt her due to lack of affection from me. I could not bear hurting her anymore so I broke up with her, but could not give a good reason for it, and it turns out she still loves me to this day and is constantly getting hurt. My siblings, parents have no idea what I am going through and often mocks me and jokingly comments on how I am good for nothing, not like other boys, ugly, etc. So I often avoid interacting with them either and isolate myself in the room for most of the time of the day. In short I am an ugly good-for-nothing living a lie in fear with no future yet with a lot of pressure on me. Thanks for reading. I did not have anyone to share this with",Depression
"The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall. ~ Marcus AureliusHow many of us, do I wonder, have felt the physical thrill of playful fighting with another as a child? Testing your strength against your father, perhaps your mother, as a child? Or play fighting with friends using sticks as magnificent swords of truthiness, and imagining the jungle gyms as your castles?As a child we all desire to be someone magnificent, no? Someone grand, who can fight the monsters and demons life throws at us, and be a beacon of hope and love for our fellows. Or mayhaps that might just be me?Because, as a child, there comes a time when we realize we are not so magnificent, we are not so powerful and full of divine strength and wisdom. We as children are faced with many moments where we are utterly helpless, and must rely on the love and kindness of others to get us through the day. I would say that we are children still, and always will be, until death teaches us our last lesson. I have come to realize that not one of the so called ""adults"" that surround me, truly know what they are doing. And I say that in a sense of, what they are doing with life, more so than what they are doing in their field of work or with their hobbies. I say that we are all still children, struggling our way through something that no one knows about, for what truly is life? What truly is the reason we have come into being?Have you ever had a child ask you question after question? Why is the sky blue? Why is the grass green? Why do I breathe? Why do I eat? Why am I alive? Why? Why? Why? it is like they are wrestling your mind this time, instead of testing their strength against yours. I worked, for a time, in a children's rehabilitation center for those who had been sexually assaulted, had sexually assaulted others, were addicted to drugs, had anger issues and have murdered. Children. Some were adolescents, some were only 12 in age and had been passed through the system because their mothers and fathers could care less about them. Why does not my mother love me, I heard once. I had not an answer. I did not know who this child's mother was because she never bothered to come visit. All I knew was that she had issues of her own, nothing excusable mind you. The child clung to me because I had answered so many of their questions before, but I had no answer then. It was only days later he was begging me not to let the police take him away. It broke me, because I did not have an answer then either. I digress, I live in a past moment. I state this because these children were wrestling their demons, but no one had taught them how too. No one had cared enough, it seemed to me, because no one wanted to, or truly knew how to, handle them. Granted there were maybe two others besides myself that wanted to do their best for the children, but its easy to burn out against a system that only cares about the money these troubled youths bring them. I do not ignore their transgressions, never that. But these were children. They were wrestling against traumas no one bothered to show them how to handle. They were mimicking the so called ""adults"" in their life they were told to trust. They were doing what was done to them. It made me truly understand that every other human being might be wrestling against their own demons, and with no one in their corner, how can one expect them to face the hundreds of opponents and circumstances that life always throws at us?Do you wrestle without knowing how to wrestle? Yes, that is how you learn. Is it easier when someone that you can trust helps you, teaches you, and shows you how to wrestle? Yes. What I am saying is there are a thousand, thousand ways to fight something. You learn alot of that on your own, and you may not know there is a better way to do it, until someone comes along and bothers to show you.My final point, is, as Marcus Aurelius states, humans, animals, organisms, will wrestle with many things in their attempt at life. Or in other terms, to live is to struggle. Knowing that, should we not all attempt to make it easier on others? Knowing that you yourself have been through many matches where you were outnumbered, with no one in your corner, can you truly blame yourself for just trying? For when the bell tolls, it signals your match is at its end. So Live. Struggle and survive. Wrestle, fight, war against life. Do not fall , stand tall and rage, rage against the machine.And stop being so damn hard on yourself For whom the Bell tolls, the wrestler, the pacifist, the young and the old, the struggling, the peaceful, the villain and the bold.",Suicidal

Wellbeing psychology and the solution focused approach have a huge amount to offer in this respect and I am currently considering the feasibility of PERMA Hypnotherapy offering a program to meet this end, combining the best from these areas to give a structured approach and an outcome that is a clear understanding of; this is what I am, this is what my life is about, here is what I am going to do and why - and this is my legacy to the world.

"I am a wretched mess. I find myself to be a terrible fucking person. I started to feel better since a few months back but right now, as of the 27th of July of 2021 at 7:35 am in the morning, I am doing worse. I want to just take a shitload of tylenol and hope that I am not the 60% of people who experience pain during liver failure.I promised my girlfriend that I would get her help. Shit, I got a panic attack brcause I could not get her an online meeting with a psychiatrist that could help her as soon as possible. I promised her she would be happy again soon. I promised her I would stay. I promised her that she would get better. But she is not. She is not getting better.I am the one making things worse, she cannot see it, but I am. The most recent argument left me devastated for no fucking reason whatsoever, apart from me realizing that its not something else that is the problem. Its not that we both have problems. Its meI am the problem.I want her to be happy and find someone better than me. Someone that will not use manipulative tactics without realising. Someone who will be able to trust her again easily even after breaking my trust once. But I broke hers ""for the better"" and that ended in a dumpster fire. All I leave behind is chaos. The bad kind of chaos. I need to pull out the weed from the flower patch by the root, so it will not grow again. I dom't want her to come with me. I want her to find someone better than me after I am gone (if I find the courage to take more than two pills of tylenol) and live those dreams we had with a proper man that will take care of her and can take care of her. I am sorry Margarita. I am sorry that I have done all of this to you. I love you. If anyone can help, please do but I want her to let go so she will have less suffering, pain and toil than what she is currently experiencing with me.

"I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends, I have no motivation for anything, no future. The only thing I still care about and have still been hanging on for is my parents. I have been thinking about suicide for a while but they are the only reason I have not gone through with it yet. Yesterday was just like any normal day, everything was fine. I had just picked up the movie Spiral and was wanting to watch it with my dad the next night since we were both big saw fans. I went to sleep and the next thing I know my family was waking me up saying he had a heart attack while on a walk with the dog. We rushed to the hospital, where they told us they could not bring him back and he was gone. It felt like such a surreal moment, like none of it was even real. I saw his body and cried so fucking much, but it is like it has not fully sunken in yet. It probably will though soon. And when it does.. I think I am finally going to do it. For the past several years I have been struggling with bad dpdr and depression, and because of it I have been avoidant of a lot of stuff. I have gone out less and less, talked to people less, even going out places with my family. Anytime they would go somewhere and asked me to come I would say no and just stay home. I wish I could take back all those times. Wish I would have not been such a lazy piece of shit and actually made the effort to get better and spend time with them. If I had actually said something, or went to a doctor about it, and not waste my life by sitting around doing nothing, avoiding it and avoiding them. Wish I would have done more with him. Wish I would have done more with all my family. A couple weeks ago I told him a bit about some of my problems, and I promised him I would start going out more and try to get better. He was one of the only things left I still cared about and lived for, and now that he is gone.. I do not think I have the strength to keep going. I am sorry to everyone. Sorry to my dad. Sorry to my family. Sorry to everyone I was ever an asshole to. I wish I could go back 10 years and just have a do over on everything. My dad just died and I think I am going to kill myself",Suicidal

"No one takes my anxiety seriously. In my family, it is no secret that I struggle with severe anxiety. I do not want to give too much detail, but they do little things that make me feel like they really do not give a crap about my anxiety. Like how I hate taking pictures, especially with other people, because I feel self-conscious and literally feel like the ugliest person alive. I told them about it and they apparently understood. Then a few days later they force me (Literally pull me by the arm) to be in a picture with them that is not even important and I instantly lost all my trust in them.I remember running to my room afterward and bawling my eyes out. I did not even want to look at the picture. I know it is not even that big of a deal, but it really affected my ability to open up to people because I felt that no matter how supportive they act, they will never really take anything I say or feel seriously and I just felt like the biggest wuss ever because, I mean, it is just a picture, right? why the hell am I so scared of a picture?Of course, this is not the only thing I am dealing with. I really hope I am not the only one that is going through this, but I do not feel human anymore. It feels like my mind has detached from my body. I do not feel present. It feels like I am floating and like I am not alive. Idk how to explain this, but it gets even worse during stressful situations. I do not know what I want anymore. It feels like my body is trying to tell me something but I do not know what it is.I remember when it started.

And then you graduate to work in an ok career, will not get much, but at least I am going to be able to have a job, just to feel like you have not actually learned a dang thing which forces you to go BACK to that academic setting that makes you want to actually commit ever since you were in school being the butt of everyone is joke, while still trying to manage working because you have to get out of ur parents house as soon as possible to live in whatever shitty place you can get if you want to cut an inch off your hair. Even tho ur parents were living at your grandmas ur whole childhood and she did not give a shit what they did with their bodies, you do not get the same range because of, take a guess, fucking politics! That are not getting any better bc no matter what fucktards get in power you are still going to be discriminated against for the rest of your life on at least 3 dif bases and the people who fight for udont actually, they just want ur vote. you are probably going to be alone also because the person you love is also dying to go back to her home state, one of the less diverse regions in the country and wants to live moving places whereas with you that just sounds like a lot of planning and uncertainty and a lot of planning and uncertainty sounds like even more stress + mocing around w/ ur profession that is not that easy (but hey i got no ambition anyways so maybe that can be arranged).

"I wish I could start over again. I feel like I missed out. I feel like I have not developed. I am generally content, but only when there is absolutely no pressure on me. As soon as there is even a smidge of pressure and am alone I lose control over my emotions and stress out over everything.I guess I should write a bit about myself. I am 22, have asperger syndrome, live with my parents and attend university (forestry major). In primary school and highschool everyone called me smart. All my live I kind of strolled through it with no resistance. I was happy. I never had trouble with anything. But once I entered university that gradually changed. Suddenly things became hard, people had expectations of me. I have to know what is to come months in advance and prepare for it.I feel fake. I do not have the passion for foresty my other classmates had. I only chose this major because I kind of liked biology class in highschool. But I never had a passion for it. In highschool I could just stroll along and do fine, but that just does not work anymore. Everyone wants me to know what I want. I do not know what I want! Or its more like I do know what I want I just want an easy life. An easy job. I wish I joined a college instead or maybe some kind of trade school, maybe I could have learned carpentry or plumbing or how to fell trees. Id be happy just working under a boss, 9 to 5, just do as I am told. I could have had my own home by now if I did that. Id be able to come home after work and do something else. Play some games, watch TV, maybe get into a new hobby like reading or writing, maybe try dating. I cannot do any of that in college. I am constantly anxious and overwhelmed and I cannot pay attention and I do not know what to do and I fear that all jobs in this field will be equally stressful and exhausting.Despite the trouble I described I largely made it through all my classes. I actually only have 1 test that I need to resit. But I do not want to do it anymore. I wish they never put the idea in my head that I am smart. I do not feel smart. I feel like an idiot that cannot handle the real world. I am so exhausted from looking for internships. I am so tired from having to do a large project each semester along with having to learn for multiple huge tests.I cannot quit university now. That would kill my mother, she is so worried about it. I can feel it in everything she does. So that is what I want to do. I want to at least finish university, and then I will see what I do.I wish I could do my entire life over again knowing what I know now. Id do it all so differently. Id spend more time being active, going outside, moving, learning new things, learning how to deal with adversity, Id find something I am passionate for or at least something I could enjoy doing as a peaceful job.I hope this rant is not against the rules or anything. I read them and it seems fine. Writing down my emotions and regrets like this makes it easier for me to process my emotions. But I do not know how long I can go without another emotional breakdown from my mounting anxiety. Either Way thanks for reading. Not sure if depressed but... Please hear me out.

What is the standard for ""getting better""? Is it living a normal life? Is it for bad cases just being able to function to a degree with permanent support from professionals and medication? Do some people just have to learn to cope with their issues for the rest of their lives?I saw a documentary on euthanasia for mental problems, two were relatively young girls with depression.

Many of the issues she stated are issues I did not know she has, and had I know, I would have worked to fix.I am trying to do anything to mend the relationship, as I love my girlfriend and I acknowledge what I have done wrong, but she states she wants space for a bit and wants to see if I can be the boyfriend she deserves.I do not know what to do. I have made my fair share of mistakes, and I am more than willing to admit it, but I feel absolutely destroyed because we both put so much love into the relationship. It just feels like a switch was pressed, and everything vanished the second it occurred. My girlfriend went from stating she loved me more than anything to being openly critical of me, and it now makes me confused as to whether or not any of those feelings were true, or if she is simply upset and truly does need space after my behavior over the past month.I did not handle the distance well, and it did send me to the mental hospital, amongst other things.

"I will try to keep my story short; but I am also venting.My partner has suffered from depression for most of her life. She has endured child sexual abuse and never healed, and every time she got hurt throughout her life it just deepend that wound and reinforced the idea in her mind that people are abusive and out to hurt each other.Because of certain events her depression has gotten worse throughout our relationship. At first it was anxiety attacks, or perhaps she hid the other stuff from me then. Now I can see she is worse than ever after a relative died. She feels she is a burden to everyone, and mostly, she feels there is no hope, that she has been suffering like this for decades, and that there is no hope for her to ever get better and live a normal life.Her average day is being constantly on edge and scared of everything. I can see in her eyes she is just exhausted. Some days she just lies in bed, stiff as a board just looking at the ceiling and crying repeating ""I do not want this anymore"" over and over softly.Recently talks of ending it have become somewhat frequent. I cannot force her to go to a health clinic, and I am in that situation where if I call them to pick her up she will not trust me again or experience it as another betrayal. In the end they will release her within a week or two and it all starts again, but then I will not be near to support her and that might be more dangerous.The other side of the coin is that I am also just a human. I am overworked, I get tired, I get annoyed sometimes. it is a lot to carry for me and I realize I am just not everything a person with severe depression could need. I am not always soft and understanding, I am not always right there to hold her hand. I feel for her, and this situation is in my head all day every day, but selfish as it is, I am also at that age where people generally go through a lot of big milestones and I have plans and goals for the future and they are all on hold. Even though her safety is more important right now, I do feel frustrated because it feels like my life is so uncertain and stagnant.I just do not know what to do or how to deal with this situation.I do not know if I am even a good thing for her. Sure I comfort her when she has anxiety attacks, and I do what I can to be supportive. But the very fact that we have a relationship is also putting pressure on her. She feels like she is not a good partner, like she is ""withholding"" sex from me. Like she is taking away my chance at a good future. Even though I try to tell her that is not the case, she still feels like that. The sex is a non-issue. She is not a bad partner because she is going through depression I can live with all that. Underneath she is an amazing person that I love to spend time with. But she is right about the other thing, I suppose. What if her depression never ends? What if truly she cannot ever overcome it and live a somewhat normal life. Am I a horrible person for not being able to see that in my future? I have had that feeling for months now. I do not tell her any of this, because that is not something she should carry now. I am kind of just waiting it out and trying to have a good relationship and hoping that she does get better at least to some degree, so that those feelings end up irrelevant.I have so many emotions and most of them conflict some way or another.

"Apologies in advanced because this is going to be a long one, tl;dr at the bottom for anyone who wants to skip over it. I am just having a bad night and found this reddit, so figured a good as place as any to get it all out there and maybe seek some kind of advice.&amp;#x200B;My mental health struggles started when I was a kid, I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin as well as told I should probably seek some type of counseling along with the treatments. However, after a few short weeks my parents took me off the meds because they did not like how it made me act (From what I hear, a common complaint.) Unfortunately no treatment or anything was ever followed up with so I have been dealing with that untreated for awhile: Honestly I am so used to it at this point that the symptoms I deal with (I have always described is as not being able to make my head silent.) are so ingrained as normal that I forgot about it for a long time.&amp;#x200B;Aside from that, I was actually a happy if not otherwise busy minded kid. However, things changed when I was ten. Without getting into the nitty gritty details two major life events happened: The first was an extremely bad car crash that left my mother with a painful and permanent physical disability that not only made living physically painful but also completely changed her personality due to the mix of pain and eventual medications. It also left me with deep mental scars which I have been told is a form of PTSD. I still cannot drive to this day because being in vehicles gives me panic attacks, even just riding does and as I am sure you can imagine a panic attack behind a driving wheel is potentially disasters as well as how...crippling it is to not be able to drive in today's world, especially when you do not live in or near a city with public options. The second thing was molestation and rape, something that went on under my parent's nose for five years. It only stopped when the person in question essentially moved away. My mother only found out a few years ago when I broke down about it - the rest of my family is still in the dark about it. This is where a lot of my problems really stem from and my life took a nose dive from this point onward. Depression, suicide attempts when I was younger, self loathing, hating the world and just all around being confused and angry at everything and everyone with no way to deal with it.&amp;#x200B;To add on to it and forgive me if this offends anyone but being a male, I felt like I could not even seek help for it for the longest time. The stigma is not as strong now ah days, though it does still exist, that many of the things that happened to me cannot really happen to guys and if it did there are..well, I am sure you get the picture. Despite this I have seen doctors, I have been given..so many diagnosis it is hard to keep any of them straight, been on a lot of pills which never seemed to work and currently am unmedicated and seeing no one.&amp;#x200B;This brings me all the current day. Despite all these issues I met someone who loves me. We got married recently. I have been happier then I had been in years, in all honesty she is the only person I have left anymore. My family wants nothing to do with me and vice versa. But now that I have someone who depends on me as much as I do them...my mental state is getting worse. &amp;#x200B;I still cannot drive. it is preventing me from getting work. My self loathing has turned into almost paranoid delusions because I cannot rectify in my mind why she would even stick with me or love me. The more she tells me it is alright, the more she tells me I do not have the worry about it, the worse it gets. The majority of her family hates me because they think I am a lazy sack of shit. I try to talk to her about it but I end up just making her feel bad, like she is doing something wrong when that is not the case. I feel like I am spiraling out of control, I feel like she would be better off without me. I just do not know what to do or how to deal with any of this. My mind is so twisted with what I think is happening and what is actually happening, I almost cannot separate the two and tell which is real and which is just my fucking head talking. I thought for awhile I was getting better but now I feel more afraid and alone then I ever have before and I am doing it entirely to myself and I do not know how to stop it.My life has felt like a constant train wreck up until this one bright point, this one little miracle happened to me and I am going to absolute shit over it. I need help. I need advice I need something. I am terrified to lose her. I am terrified of hurting her some way or another or dragging her down with me. I just do not want to be alone anymore yet I feel like I am driving myself towards that inevitable conclusion.So if anyone has any advice..anything at all please...help me. Sorry for the long post..just needed to get it out.tl;dr PTSD, life long depression, ADHD, all relatively untreated. Managed to fall in love and get married. Was happier. Now it is all crashing back down and just...royally fucking with me. cannot drive, cannot get a job, feel completely alone and worthless. Afraid to hurt the one person I love. cannot imagine what she sees in me. Not sure what to do with my life anymore",Depression
"When I talk to my family about it, I am obviously stressing them out. So I am turning to here. Also they say that I have two options, suck it up, or they will send me to the mental hospital. They think I can just snap out of it by thinking positive, I try. But intrusive thoughts are INTRUSIVE. And I cannot solve the issue of my lows (absolute sadness, feel like I am being held down by bricks) and highs (anger and screaming rage) when there is LITERALLY NO because. They do not understand what I mean, they think its me choosing this. Its been months. If you guys listen to Hobo Johnson, I am sure you have heard him say that hell get therapy when he can afford it. Well, I am in that position, a bitch cannot pay for therapy, or afford a psychiatrist. Idk what to do. I am trying to better my life by saving money, and doing my life goals, but LIVING is not looking fun to me anymore. I have planned my suicide, I think if it 50+ times a day with intrusive thoughts.

"Any form of intimacy gives me severe nausea. To describe it in detail, you know that feeling you get when you are about to throw up? Your saliva is basically the consistency of water and you feel something being thrown up your esophagus? that happens, but i never throw up. i get on the verge of vomiting but it never comes. this would in turn lead to a racing thoughts, shortness of breath, and every other symptom of anxiety you can think of. This happened to some degree almost every single time. did not matter what the form of intimacy was (talking, cuddling, kissing, or having sex), but the more sexual the situation the worse the anxiety nausea was.I have only ever had one partner and we were together for about 4 months but i had to break up with her because the anxiety got so severe that my feelings were lost for her because i was overwhelmed with how intense the nausea and anxiety was. it got to the point where even just hanging out with her (and have nothing go on between us) made me sick to my stomach, and sometimes she could not even touch me or i could not even look at her. she was not abusive or manipulative by any means, in fact she was the most supportive person i could have asked for. when things were getting steamy she would ask if i was okay and if i needed a minute (when the nausea happened i would step out of the room/car and walk around taking deep breaths) and she completely understood. she showered me with acceptance and understanding and i still could not get over the nausea and anxiety. We were completely open and transparent with eachother and it still happened. The level of nausea varied each time, though. sometimes it was a little, other times it was so intense i could not move. only a few times did i not have nausea at all. Now, after breaking up with her a few months ago i have had multiple opportunities to even just hang out with a woman platonically 1 on 1 and i completely avoid it because it freaks me the fuck out. i do not want to have any form of intimacy anymore because i know how anxious and nauseous i will get. It just sucks because I am comfortable with like sending nudes and stuff and that is about it. i feel like such an asshole for even doing that because i know i will not be able to go any further than that. I get this problem with other things too, like eating and going on vacation, as well as being deathly scared of smoking and drinking, but this particular situation is where it gets the most intense and the most frequent. I am on Prozac for my anxiety, if that is any additional information that may help. this whole thing has spiraled me into a deep pit of self consciousness and even self hatred. I have had countless nights just lying awake thinking about what is wrong with me and why i cannot justenjoy life the way i want without having to be controlled by the way my stomach decides to act one day. I do not need a solution as soon as possible, i just need a place to start in order to fix me.

"it is impossible to be happy in this cold cruel world. Everything's got to be serious and unfun.

I am 21. The moment I heard that I knew that a chill life will never happen. Nor will I be happy. This is a life of cruelty and suffering, one that will not let me take a break.

"A few days ago I was talking with a friend of mine, and he said that a mutual friend of ours kept flaking on him. So hes been giving her the cold shoulder. He then said that he does not have to worry about it because hell just hang out with me instead. Instead. Maybe I am just misremembering, or overthinking it because we have been friends for over a year now, maybe even two but I thought he was just telling me: Id rather be hanging out with her but you will do. I thought I could get over it, because I immediately just shrunk into myself when he said it but I cannot. Its a confirmation of every single fear I have ever had, every time I have ever felt alone, every time I have ever felt like dying. Now, every time I talk to someone, I wonder: Am I just an option to them? Do they even like me? Would they even care if I was gone? I just, cannot! I cannot get it out of my fucking head. I have not had a dark thought in weeks, and for the first time in a long time I was happy with my life. And now it feels like all of my fears and assumptions and doubts were true. My rational side is saying I am just overthinking it, we have been friends for a long time. It was just conversation, and a miscommunication at worst.

"Ever since i was little my parents have always fought and blamed everything on me, just turned 18 yesterday and still nothing has changed. My parents put there expectation on me initially becoming a tennis player, so they trained me for 11 years of my life, i had no childhood as i would immediately after 3.30pm after eating would play tennis 3 hours for years on end, high school was difficult as i was unable to multitask between tasks. (i was good at tennis, but i know my limitations so i told them i give up) they blamed me for months on end for ruing there dreams and money, i should have told them when i was younger but if i did i was scared what would happen to me as my parents hated/despised my existence if i was no use to them. Then i aimed to become a doctor, year 11, age 15, after breaking up with my first girlfriend who was my emotional scapegoat since my parents hated me, our relationship was toxic and my first love chose another individual because i was too much of a coward to ask her out. During when i had a girlfriend year 10, my parents would antagonise me that i should not fall in love, it ruined my tennis career and education. During my relationship with my girlfriend i realised the way my parents where treating me, my lack of social awareness and how enclosed my life was (did not know youtube, anime, insta, etc. till i was 15). So i slowly began to shut them out of my life, both parents would antagonise me, act like my support, but then immediately backstabbed me when they had the chance, blame everything on me and have me as a common enemy (this was norm in my life and still is). My parents still antagonise me for falling in love to the point, I am so depressed that my friends slowly forgot about me and the only form of happiness i still have left is anime, lego or games.My parents antagonise me on how successful they are and how much of a disgrace i'am compared to them, I am a freeloading leech that takes everything for granted, whilst offering nothing in return. The way my parents brought me up i have speech impediment (stutter and i cannot formulate sentences quickly and i struggle to talk), i get bullied and still laugh, get emotional scarred and people still expect me to smile. I only laugh and smile at school while i had friends, but since i graduated i have no friends and no one talks to me, except my parents who ostracise my very existence as a mistake everyday. Also during a biology class after receiving crappy marks in chemistry and getting scolded by my parents, i slit my wrist with a scalpel, my friends at the time took me to the nurse and i had some medicine/band-aid applied to my wrist, scared of what my parents will say to me i hid it, when i woke up, my band-aid was gone and i was sure they saw it since i live in a small apartment i sleep in the same room. Come morning it seemed as if they did not care or wanted to care about my injury. I wanted to kill myself since the age of 5, i prayed i would die everyday to relive my parents burden f having me, i was too afraid to end it myself, so I would hope i got into a freak accident or was killed, unfortunately nothing has happened yet.I go uni now and study software engineering, having received a atar of 77.85, which was a far cry from studying medicine. I want to make friends at uni but my speech impediment, how i look (I am not exactly what you call a good looking guy, i know I am ugly), but i still continue to hope on. I skipped over alot of my past because it is better left unknown. I just turned 18 yesterday, i was hoping i would die before turning into a adult, kind of disappointed to be honest, woke up immediately scolded for looking sad, i only had 2 friends remember my birthday, 2 family friends and my parents obligated wishes. As time flew more and more people forgot about me, which is not bad because i always wanted to be forgotten i guess. When cutting the cake, the asked me to smile, but i would not since i was sad i was still alive. They started to curse me like always for not being thankful for what i have, they always like to monitor what i do so they check my phones and stuff. I have a younger sibling who is blessed, they receive everything from my parents i wish i had, whom i also stopped talking to after my parents routinely check on my email, where they discovered me and my friends joke round calling each other names and stuff. One of my friends called me gay as a joke, which my sister called me infront of all her friends who are in highschool too. The only person who i had close relations with made me feel betrayed for putting trust in them. My parents made me ""reconcile"" with them, which i acted as i did, but never felt that they were sincere (happened 2 years ago). I am trying to get my first job at retail so i leave the house more and can contribute money to the family and am not a leech, but no one is hiring since covid and i have no work experience. So i need to wait until covid bans are lifted if I am still alive lol.Now to today, my parents spoke to me again about how much of a disappointment i'am, i make myself numb to pain by holding back tears and looking pan face all the time, but i cried for the first time to them for the first time in 2 years despite them ""calling me out"" for different things, even them all wishing i was dead and if they had known i was going to be born they would have aborted me or calling me a mistake. My parents said they probably made a mistake when they received there baby from the nursery, which broke my heart. I act stone face to hide my tears and sadness, but i did not say anything back to them, because whenever i did i would make things worse for myself by expressing my feelings. Imagine ur friend consoling you despite being reluctant, when you finally get consoled, there pissed at you for taking forever and things get worse. Like that so i just be quiet and only nod my head or giving 1-2 word answers. They feel no remorse and continued to talk to me. Later on one of them comes and asks me why i cried saying they were surprised, i choose not to say anything so they lecture me for 1 hr 30mins asking why, telling me there hardships and how much of a failure i am. Here i am now on the verge of decided whether to jump of my apartment or not, I have written and signed a couple of draft notes on what i done to my body after i die (donated to medical research or organ transplants), removes more burdens of my parents. Idk what to do sorry for wasting your time, this is more of a rant if anything. Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english despite it being my first language. What do i do?",Suicidal

"it is never going to get easier... Graduated high school a decade ago this year. Nothing to show for it. And still depressed as ever.

My friends (that i still have) are starting families and buying houses... i still have no clue what i want to do with my life... kind of feel like i messed up.. should have gone to college. should have taken more chances on things. could not ever find love. and honestly i do not blame them (any of the women I have talked too or had relationships with). I cannot even love myself so how can i try to love someone else or let them love me? that is not fair to them.. I do not know why I am even here.

"Have been feeling depressed for quite a while. A lot of it has to do with my future goals and career, just general anxiety and fear for the future. Will be entering college this fall and sorta feel weird about life. I have friends from hs but we do not really talk and I do not really have anyone in my life to talk to, or want to talk to. I am just overall very neurotic about my future career. Ill be going down a very difficult and long career path that I believe objectively is one of the hardest ones out there (medicine). I have been working really hard to get opportunities and building up my resume and stuff. While I am doing stuff I do like, I do not feel happiness in life. There really is not anything that brings me joy. I also feel bad about my body. Sometimes I look at old photos and feel really bad about how I have gained weight. I have struggled with an ED before but I do not have ed issues anymore, but it does not stop me from feeling bad about myself. And yea I just do not really feel anything, and I do not know if I want to seek professional help. Like overall I feel like the road ahead is going to be very difficult and tiring and I just want a break but I feel like I have not been working hard enough as I have been doing a lot of comparing myself with others lately.Just wanted to get this all off my chest.

"I was in a long distance relationship for almost two years. I put everything I had into this relationship. It was very real to me. I come to find out that he has been cheating on me and using me while I was trying to help him get back on his feet. I asked him about it and he blocked me. Two years of my life wasted. Funny thing was, if I had not met him I would be dead already. The last time I flew to see him, he ghosted me. I cannot anymore",Suicidal
I was looking at some past friends social media and it made me realize even more how sad and pathetic my life really is. And yes before anyone says it I know social media is not real and only shows people the good sides and blah blah blah but still its clear these people are at least doing something in there life and trying to go after their dreams while I am just laying in bed..doing absolutely nothing for the past 4 years. Also I have no friends. I still really do not know why I have absolutely no friends like there are people who are absolutely shit and have tons of friends but I do not. At this point after this many years I have come to the conclusion I am just unlikeable for some reason. And I SWEAR to fucking GODDDD if someone tries to give me some advice on how to make friends. Trust me when I say I have done everything you possibly could to make friends. At this point I have given up and have decided to be friendless forever. Even if somehow someone all of a sudden wanted to be friends with me Id turn them down because Id be too pissed off that for some reason now that I do not give a shit about being alone now someone is trying to befriend me Id be mad.

"I grew up on a farm where I saw a lot of brutal animal death at a young age and on top of all this I witnessed my parents marriage and sanity almost dissolve. Thankfully they are still together but the beginning days of the dairy farm really gave me a wakeup call that my parents did not know everything and were not the best decision-makers. I am now 25, battling intrusive thought OCD for 7 years and often extremely depressed. I try not to show it but I really want to die most days. I am kind of known as the funny guy by those around me but that is all just ""put on"" when in social settings. I feel obligated to not plan such a thing as my own suicide, because I do care about my parents and siblings, but in regards to life itself, I just wonder what is the point?I do not necessarily believe in a heaven or higher purpose, and I despair at the fact that so much unchangeable pain and death has already happened. My ""friends"" that I have always seem to surprise me with their lack of empathy about certain things and joking attitude about things as painful and saddening as suicide. They do not know that its something that is always on my mind, but their jokes about suicide still hurt because it is a serious subject. I feel so incredibly trapped by life and so in pain by intrusive thoughts. I seriously cannot tell anymore where intrusive thoughts end and where my conscious choices and ideas begin. I am a visual person that is always seeing bad imagery in my mind of things I do not want, and its so persistent that I do not always know if its me. At this point, if someone asked me if I am a good or bad person, I would say ""Yeah, I am bad"", despite the fact that I have never actually ""done"" something to anyone. I do not tell anyone this but I often wish I had never been born at all when my mind is racked with guilt and confusion. I do not think I am mentally ill, but there have been some moments in my teenage years when I did start to slip down the path of total confusion, such as a time in which I thought I may be the same person as my father. Yeah, it sounds stupid, but I thought since we did have a lot in common and he did look a lot like me at my age, maybe we were actually the same person. I often just feel that I am not in control of the types of thoughts I have and I feel at a loss for words about the kind of aimless person I am now.But honestly one of the biggest things that bursts any desire to further myself for a better life, is the hopeless of isolation. I have yet to forge an actual close friendship in the past 10 years or more. This is excluding my siblings and parents. Something where both people understand and are open with each other. Yeah, I can spout to one of my ""friends"" some philosophical commentary on life, but that is just surface level crap. I have never dated and do not know if I have it in me. So a lonely life ahead sounds miserable too tbh.The stuff where I genuinely tell someone how I REALLY feel about my life, my pain, my hopelessness and my internal rage at myself never happens. I begin to tell them personal stuff because their seemingly trustful, but then I see that they really are not engaged, and they may not even be listening.Because I keep convincing myself not to commit suicide, I often instead find myself just saying ""I wish life was already over by now."" I mean, its going to happen one day. Why cannot it just hurry up already for me, since its always looming in the background like an inescapable punishment. I know I should not feel this way, and I am sorry for that, but as this reddit group already knows, this is one of the only places where some people can vent their frustration or share their pain in the hopes that improvement will come from fellow sufferers. I think I have some repressed anxiety from childhood that really comes out in despair.",Suicidal

"One thing someone said to me after telling them some of the things I have been through is that I am actually one of the strongest people there is for getting through it and still being someone who spreads positivity. The thing is, I am not strong. Barley anyone knows everything that is happened to me or about the void its left in my heart. I keep it hidden. I am a goofy type of person, so I hide it with laughter. I try to make people laugh and do good things as a distraction. Doing these good things makes me feel better about myself for a short amount of time. Like I said though, I am not strong. I constantly let myself get triggered and start remembering the trauma. I get so anxious sometimes that its hard to hide, and I am so terrified of opening up about it to many of the people I care about because I am afraid of letting myself be vulnerable like that. I know its probably irrational, but I am afraid that if they know the full story, they will come to see me the way that I see myself as a result of it all. Yet on the contrary, whenever I get anxious and start having flashbacks and stuff, I want nothing more than to have someone to break down to and to be completely vulnerable with without having to worry about how it would change their perception of me. I wish I could just let it all out like a little kid, but that vulnerability terrifies me. It results in a vicious cycle that I am aware is completely self inflicted, I am like the author of my own misery. If I was actually all that strong, Id be able to talk about it in detail without tensing up and getting sweaty and anxious. If I was actually strong, Id be able to not worry about being vulnerable like that. The fact that I do not have that strength is part of what makes me loathe myself so much. Does anyone else relate to all of this? Are these signs of PTSD or depression, or is all of this normal for someone with trauma in their past? I cannot stop letting my past haunt me",Depression
"I have not been on this subreddit in over five months. I cannot believe that I was actually contemplating suicide. It used to be on my mind constantly.

"As the title says, the week of July 12th was one of the worst in my life. I feel completely defeated at this point and I just want to give up. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for the last 7 years, and, for awhile, it was helpful for me. We found a good cocktail of medicine that helped me feel normal, and helped me function with my day-to-day activities. But, around the end of May I noticed that my meds just were not as effective as they once were. I have to state that I have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and PTSD since 2003. I have also been suffering from insomnia in varying degrees of severity since then as well. I cannot stress how absolutely miserable it is to want nothing more than to sleep and not be able to.So back to the 7/12. I had been visiting my family for awhile since I have been working from home for a year and half, and I did not want to be alone every single day. Plus, I missed our family dog dearly. So it was great to spend time with her. While I was home, I also got a dog for myself, just, the sweetest little thing. But low and behold, she was born with a genetic condition that requires she get a total hip replacement. that is going to be 8K after all is said and done. I do not have that kind of money. Not at all. Anyway, when I left to come back home to take care of things here, I left my dog behind because her surgery was scheduled back where my folks live and I did not want to stress her out with a lot of back and forth travel. When I left, I did not get an opportunity to say bye to our 15 year old family dog. I figured I was coming back for my dogs surgery in August, so Id see her then. And then I found out my family had to put her down on 7/12. That little dog meanteverything to me. I have been used and abused and discarded by people all my life. My family (not my nuclear family, but the rest), my friends, everyone. But that little critter loved me unconditionally. And now she is gone. And I did not get to say bye to her. Furthermore, my dog is slated for surgery on 8/12, one month to the day of the other dogs passing. And, while I am not superstitious, its still causing massive anxietyjust in case anything happens to her. When I got back home I found a new psychiatrist; Id changed insurance earlier this year. However, he does not accept insurance and its $500 a session. I researched psychiatrists in my area and hes highly recommended and rated. And I like him. However, the costyeahalso not helpful for my stress and anxiety. We also changed my anti-depressantwhich now costs me 400 bucks a month. Again, cannot afford any of this. My weekly therapy is $130. I earn a good amount of money but I happen to live in one of the most expensive areas in the US, so my income does not go too far. So I have just been panicking. I am in a ton of debt. I have been trying to do everything right to help better myself. But every time I start to make progress it gets derailed. I have gained about 90 pounds in the last year. And I cannot seem to lose it or change my dietary habits because its so hard for me to care when I feel so exhausted. My job sucks, I am paid 60% of what I should be earning in my field as an entry-level position (though I have been doing this for 7 years). I have started looking for other jobs but its just exacerbating my anxiety. Like, to the point where its crippling. I feel like I am barely holding it all together and that, at any moment, the dams going to burst and Ill just spiral. I do not know what to do anymore. Id love for all of this to just be over.

I really think this session could have gone well if I controlled myself and analyzed my thoughts. it is been so tough these past days and I just could not take it anymore. My therapist was left speechless and could not put a word in. it is ok to have a shoulder to cry on but it is depressing knowing there is only so much they can do but listen. I just want things to be better but so much is going wrong. I am so lost. I am so confused. I am starting to have homicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. I am so angry.

"TLDR: they got worse but at least plan c is gone Basically I made a post at one point saying I had three separate plans and a whole lotta bad thoughts, so check that first for context.Good news is: plan c is no longer a plan. I cannot interact with people well enough to get a date in the first placeBad news: mostly bad news. The thoughts are still there and boy oh boy are they growing. So during a few meltdowns I have done a real bad thing where I just walk out and go as far away as possible, remembering plan A in the process. Now they have been nagging me to do it more outside of meltdowns - mall, grocery store, park; hell, we got in a car crash a few weeks ago (dw everyone is ok) and I thought to just start walking and hope no one notices. Literally the only thing that stopped me was the cops sowing up to assess the damage. Speaking of plan a, that is also been nagging more. Not much to elaborate there.Another thoughts been growing, the one that I have had it too good. Been noticing my appetites going down cuz I feel like I do not deserve whatever I am eating. More commonly with meltdowns Ill try to get rid of clothes, jewelry, phone, etc thinking only good kids get to have it. I hardly even want to go anywhere anymore cuz all the fun places are good kid things and I should not have that. Even the bed I am laying in while typing feels wrong to sleep in.I have lorazepam in case they get too bad but I always refused and threatened to take the whole bottle, and now I am legit afraid to take it in case I decide to go through with it 2am update on the thoughts and plans",Suicidal

"So, I have a teenage brother who does not act his age but he is not sped or anything. I am about to turn 20 and he still wants to sleep with me. I feel uncomfortable sleeping with him (we both have our own beds) and I am in my mom's room since I am babysitting and he wants to sleep with me. I told him, you are not a little boy, go sleep in your room. I was told my depression was quite high and I tend to overreact sometimes but I just cannot control how I feel. I started crying from being upset and he still would not budge. My grandma said why I am so against it and I told her ""He mocks my depression every single time. You think I will feel comfortable sleeping with someone who mocks my depression?"" that is when both my grandma and aunt said ""it is all in your head. Control your feelings. it is just a minor thing, no need to overreact""I KNOW I am OVERREACTING BUT ITS NOT SOMETHING I CAN CONTROL. THEM SAYING ""ITS ALL IN YOUR HEAD"" MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT they are DISMISSING MY DEPRESSION AS SOMETHING SMALL. I FEEL REALLY HURT. I KNOW I ACT CHILDISH BUT I JUST cannot CONTROL MY FEELINGS. IT TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE FOR ME TO COME OUT TO SAY ""I HAVE DEPRESSION"" but i regret I ever did. They do not take my depression well. I attempted an overdose but they do not change their behavior towards me. Why did I ever decide to trust them?? All I ever wanted from them was to say they love me and that they will support me and take my depression seriously. Why is it that I feel that my doctor cares more than my family??

"that is it really. I am on my last legs here and I do not know what is dumb and what is not. I am trans and I know I will *never* be able to come out of the closet but when I think about it even if I could what would that change? I blocked a bunch of my friends recently and plan to go back but am worried that is ruined forever with some of them and am kind of resigned to it. I understand if they do not forgive me. I was upset by something one of them said, I was upset at myself. They just asked me kindly not to make a certain kind of comment and I had a meltdown. I wanted to hurt myself so bad but I just got out of a therapy session about not doing that and it stuck in my head. I did not but I am not proud of it. I do not feel any better or good about it at all. I felt like I still needed to do something rash hence the blocking. I was so happy before and in a split second, I have crumbled to this familiar bullshit. I got out of a cult recently that my family remains firmly in, hence the fear of them. I cannot cut ties with them though, I do not want to. they are not bad people. I know they will never stop loving me no matter what and a lot of them suffer from the same things as me, depression and suicidal tendencies, they have kept me alive this long. I do not want to die. God, I do not fucking care if I live or not. I just do not see any other options. I have been doing okay with just hurting myself and am trying to balance stopping that without falling into suicide attempts. I feel like I have got to reach a certain level of fucked up before anyone will or should bother to help me. I want to be as pathetic as possible because if I get better people will stop being so careful when I still need it as much as they can offer. My throat is incredibly swollen right now from an illness. My friends made me care. I did not want them to miss me, I love them. I do not care right now. I am angry at them because I cannot afford to be angry at myself anymore. I would not survive it. I can either be an unpleasant, maybe even *bad,* person or a dead man. I do not want to die, but I do not believe I have a solution and I really would not care if I dropped dead right now. I do not want to kill myself, I could never stab or poison my body, but if I just stepped in front of a train or off a cliff I think that would be nice. I need someone to tell me I should not kill or maim myself",Suicidal

"As I type all this out, I am certain that the final chapter to my story is coming to a close. I am so lost. So empty. So bewildered. I do not even know what I am feeling right now, let alone who I even am. I can barely formulate words to describe to you how mentally fucked I am. that is why it is taken me over 7 draft's and 4 month's to type this post out. I want to apologize in advance if I am all over the place here.I really miss being a kid. I was a charming fellow who oozed optimism. Everywhere I went, I radiated positivity. Perhaps you could mistake this for innocence? Regardless though, everything was so different then. The only thing that mattered to me was catching the latest episode of Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Never in a million years would I have expected to grow up and be worth less than the ground beneath your feet. Here I am at 21 and I have become, nothing. I do not have a car, I just got a job (and I probably will not keep it for much longer), I have no one to love or appreciate me, the little amount of ""friend's"" I have are slowly pushing me out of their lives, my credit is fucked. The only thing I have is Music. But even still, it can only go so far. Drowning out my thoughts in tune is great and all but eventually, I will be brought back to reality and my little fantasy will vanish.It does not help that I still live with my emotionally abusive, narcissistic mother. what is worse is that, realistically, she is the only remaining person in my life and because of this, I am forced to love her. But loving her fucking hurts. It feel's as if I am walking on egg she will's when I am around her. She constantly gaslight's and manipulate the fuck out of me to the point where now she has complete control over my life and emotions. Not only is everything my fault but she convinces me that I have said thing's to her and I cannot recall me ever doing so. If I try to strike up a conversation, she pays little to no attention to what I am saying what so ever, and then scolds me for not talking to her. She always calls me inadequate and weak. Whenever I mention a promise she made to me, or something hurtful she is said to me in the past, she acts like she has no idea what I am referring to and say's, ""...that does not even sound like me. I would never say anything like that to you..."". Everything she says to me leaves me questioning my past and rationality. Maybe I am a weak, lesser-human ass pussy that overreacts and exaggerates? As fucked as it sounds, at times I wish she would just bawl her hands up into a fist and let out all her frustration and anger onto me. But she does not. So instead, I take a blade to my arm and ""brand"" words onto it.it is incredibly difficult for me to describe my emotion's. it is almost as if my brain is like the physical manifestation of White Noise. Most of the time I feel so dissociative, my entire being is on auto-pilot and I do not really ""snap out of it"" until I am in stressful situations. But by then, anxiety ensues and I start trembling. Like now for example.Suicide has been the hand tugging at my shirt for as long as I can remember, as far back as my youth. I even attempted twice this year, and unfortunately I am still here to tell the tale. I know a lot of people attempt because they want for their pain to end. For me, it is a bit different. My pain will not end. As long as my heart beat's, I will forever remain this way. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. These thought's will never stop. I will never not be depressed and miserable. it is been almost a decade since I have been this way, and it will never end. I have tried almost everything: therapy, meditation, religion, hotlines, support groups. Nothing. Next time, I want to ensure my method will work. I do not want to survive and end up in a vegetated state or losing half of my face or what have you. Last month, I watched as my childhood friend was buried 6 feet under. He shot himself. Well, I take that back. I did not attend the funeral. My mom guilt tripped me out of doing so. Imagine what kind of shit friend I am. Pathetic. No wonder everyone is pushing me away.I have no idea what to expect when I post all this but...it is really late. I am not making any sense right now. If you managed to read through this bible's worth of text and hear me rambling and being a bitch, thanks I guess. Maybe someone might give a fuck. I have a treat for you. it is the only gift I can give this world: half decent taste in music. Listen to ""A Different Age by Current Joys"", the whole album. it is been on repeat as I have typed out all this bullshit. If you are as low as me, maybe this album will speak to you as it is done to me. me rambling a bunch about my life being so cruel.",Suicidal

"so, this might be a little long. sorry about that in advance anyway.like the title said I have no idea what I am doing with my life, not trying to feel sorry for myself by posting this or anything I just do not know what to do anymore. I had a very complicated childhood, my parents never let me get an education. (and by that I mean not at all, I never did any school work, or even went to school at all when I was a kid/teen.)my spelling is almost nonexistent and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to improve it (using a mix of autocorrect/google translate to write this out) and my math is awful, but I did manage to teach myself to read quite well though.I was not allowed to talk to other kids growing up and so I had no friends growing up and was not allowed to leave the house at all, only sometimes to go shopping with my dad or mom. and I went out even less after my father killed himself when I was 8.the first time I talked to someone/went outside by myself was when I was 16 and it was to get milk and other stuff because my mom just got too lazy and she could not be bothered anymore I suppose. as you probably guessed I have extreme social anxiety and can barely talk to other people even till this day.this might sound awful and I feel awful for saying this, but covid is probably the best thing to ever happen to me I was able to move out with one of my sisters because of government benefits, because of this I was able to look inward and able to see how badly I was treated by my family and to see that I might have a lot of mental problems because of this.I do not know how I thought my home life was normal, but I had my mom calling me useless because I was unable to get a job and pay her rent, and most of my siblings treated me like dirt acting grossed out just from seeing me, and some of them even used to tell me that: I should kill myself because no one would miss me anyway"".the only people in my family I am close with are my two little sisters and my older brother though he cut everyone in our family off including me because his wife does not like any of us which hit me hard.my family has pretty much fallen apart a surprise to anyone reading this I am sure haha.so that brings us to today I am 23 years old have no education, do not have any friends, I cannot get a job, and I Might be homeless soon.I am seeing a psychologist soon. I do not think it will help me much honestly. I wake up every day scared of being homeless I cannot relax anymore, I do not enjoy anything in life anymore. for anyone who is worried I do not think I am suicidal, but I am honestly finding it hard to find a reason to live anymore.to anyone who made it to the end of this probably very badly spelled post, Thank you.

"So much shame inside my head. I was raised in a Christian household, I was raised with proper, well adjusted parents. No trauma, no abuse, no abandonment or lack. Up until high school I always had at least one best friend, literally I always had one person who would agree with me that I was their best friend. Wed play tag a recess or just walk around the playground and talk about random shit. I went to church every Sunday, went to the beach with family, got along great with my siblings, parents had no favorites and treated us all equally, I had a cat I adored though admittedly sometimes terrorized it, I had (have technically, still living in the same home) a huge backyard that I played in almost every day with my siblings, we had (again have technically) amazing neighborhood friends. I would wake up every day with legitimate joy and wonder, I was excited, even for school. I had the kind of childhood that probably makes most people on this sub seethe with envy. Those people would read my post with incredulity, how in the living fuck is this guy? Why does he belong here?? He could not possibly understand what we have been throughand I agree. I do not. I do not know what the fuck is wrong with me, yet somehow I am emotionally and psychologically stunted, I isolate myself from family, I lash out at others for the smallest things, I victimize myself quite a bit, I just have a genuine disdain for this life. I feel like I have so much to say and yet my brain is so foggy. Of course when I want to say something my brain locks up, but if I want to sleep and relax, suddenly World War III has erupted in my head. Not that anyone would pay attention anyway, I understand that I am just another faceless person on this sub, whining about the same shit over and over and over again, just like everybody else. I was never popular, never had much attention given to me outside of family (yeah I know I sound pretty spoiled, many people on this sub could not even get attention from their family). I guess my problem is that I am just soterribly average and normal in all kinds of ways, and very much not average in all the wrong ways, in very disgusting ways, if that makes any sense. I have all this disgusting and inhuman traits, and nothing good. I have nothing to offer, I just should not fucking be here. Why did the universe allow me to be conceptualized? Why did my biological parents, whoever they are (adopted), have to create me?? All I ever wanted to do was be a super empathetic, compassionate, loving, safe, kind, accepting, giving, and joyful person. I am none of those. I am quickly losing my ability to empathize with others because I hurt too much, I cannot extend compassionate or love because reality is too cold and harsh, I do not feel safe with myselfhow long until that happens with other people as well? I am not very kind, I am super grumpy and angry at life and everyone in it, I am becoming very unaccepting of others because I feel like the universe or god has rejected me, I am not joyful, that is just a big no, I cringe at happy and uppity people. The only silver lining here is that I am sort of giving, only because I hate myself so much that I want to serve others (albeit in small ways) and forget I exist, I want to be put last. At the same time though I hate that I am feeling so left outso I want to be heard and acknowledged, but I cannot get any acknowledgment or attention from who it matters most..I am a horrible person with sickening thoughts anyway, why should I get any sort of acknowledgment. I should not get to have friends, to have a girlfriend (have not had one ever lol), to have a family that cares about me, to have hopes or dreams, I am nothing, I am no one important or special. I am just a dirty rag, I am the one cracked egg, the defective product, I have no purpose or use other than to be thrown away and discarded. I am understanding this and accepting this more and moreHonestly I barely care at this point whether people care anymore. I do not carethats all that matters. I am trying to think of other things to say, but that is probably a sign that I should stop. I have said all I can say, I have said many things multiple times over. I am not unique, I am not special, I am not someone anyone wants to be friends with or someone to look up to, I have no special qualities, no good looks, no intelligence, no wit or ability to make others laugh, I do not make anyone feel special or noticed or important, I do not make anyone excited when I walk in the room, if anything I suck the life out of the room, everyone watches me from their peripheral view, analyzing me to see what I want or what I am going to do, eager to see me leave. I justdont get it. I serve zero purpose and have no function. When people on this sub or anywhere else try and give me to stay, what is the fucking reason? could not be because I will help humanity, could not be because I have some special to offer, could not be because I look good, or give people the giggles, or befriend others easily, or make people feel at ease and calm, important, heard, it could not be because of anything good is my damn point. What do you want me to just sit in the corner and merely exist for the sake of my family? What kind of fucking life is that? Clearly no one in this world needs me, so you cannot possibly imply that there is some greater goal for me to achieve, or people to meet, or grand adventure to go on. I cannot do fucking anything that this world needs me to do, I cannot be anything this worlds need me to be, so just let me fucking go. Unfortunately society will not help me in this endeavor, so I must undergo this task alone, via hanging of the self. It should be fun. I do not care about the pain or slow agony of suffocating anymore, if anything I look forward to it in a sick way. I know I do not matter and do not have any worth or use, so its for the best. I am a creepy weirdo anyway, so I am just imagining all the faces of the people who will feel at ease knowing there is one less potentially dangerous person in the world, and Ill be happy knowing I will not live long enough to be one of them. So thanks for everything I guess, reddit has been a huge life saveruntil it is not I guess lmao. But seriously you guys helped me get through a lot of shitty moments, helped me fall under the illusion that I was not alone and I actually had a tribe, like I had found my people. I know my people do not exist, or if they do they are incredibly fucked up and nasty, and I do not want any empathy or compassion from them, I do not want to be related to them in any way shape or form. So Ill choose to kill myself instead. I literally cannot wait. For those of you who are leaving with me, see you on the other side (if there actually is one). Hopefully its a much better place than this, and we can ride on the cloud tops laughing at all the suckers stuck down here thinking its worthwhile. that would be awesome haha.

"listen, i cannot forcefully stop you but i can explain my story.back when i was severely suicidal (on watch 24/7) you could not even TAKE UR EYES OFF OF ME. i was just so tempted to do it i just could not resist.i still have my battle scars to this day.before i was admitted to the mental facility, my brother told something to me that i will never forget to this day; ""i may sound like an idiot, but you do not want to go the easy way out, you got to go the hard way out."", life has its moments, that does not change ur value.we all go through tough time, my dudes, and we have all experienced the thoughts.but when you feel such, think about the people that love and care for you, without you, the world is hopeless, we all have no hope. what can we do without you? were nothing without you. you are the glue that is holding this failed 4th grade science project we call **life.****When we recognize that someone is having suicidal thoughts, and we reach out, we are instantly planting a seed of hope that they are not invisible, that they are not alone.** **-misty vaughan allen** advice for the suicidal or the thinkers",Suicidal

"So, I tend to get depressive episodes on a fairly regular basis (when I am at optimal mental health I get mild to severe dips like a week before my cycle that then go away within a few days) but I have been having some longer than normal ones lately, and I have been stuck in that sinking black hole for about two full weeks now. Summers always tend to be worse for me since I start to feel alienated and extremely lonely since I am not in college classes and I am stuck with just my parents and my brother. I struggle making friends, and the only people I talk to on a regular basis are all online and live on the opposite end of the continent. I have only really had one irl friend, who keeps ghosting me. I am very motivated by being able to experience things with others, so this has resulted in a lot of me not doing anything at all.I love my family, but they have zero filter and often do not understand that because of my depression and mild anxiety, I sometimes do not take jokes very well, especially ones targeting things I am already struggling with. And like all family members, they love to poke and prod until I snap at them or, in rare cases, until I start crying. A lot of times, their comments will hit me right in the anxiety and I have that moment of ""I have to change everything about myself so I am perfect. Perfect people do not get made fun of."" and it is driven me to actively avoid things I love, as well as mental heath topics, when they are around. it is always a chore trying to navigate that in the summers. Everything has just been so much worse lately for some reason. there is just this ugly feeling in my chest and that horrible need to just make people hate me so I can justify feeling this way. This is easily the worst I have been mental health-wise in like a year, and I am starting to struggle a little and letting the bad thoughts linger. Sorry for the long post. there is a lot going on in my head and my life that I need to parse through I guess. Been A Little Rough Lately",Depression
"I have dealt with depression pretty much my whole life, I am 34 now. let us get some basics out of the way: single, manager at an office for a bank, short enough to be self conscious about it, and just getting sober from weed.I am trying to clean the house because mom is visiting soon, but damn, I can barely do anything because nothing at this moment seems worth it. that is a familiar feeling, but it is hitting hard. I know I will work tomorrow, but when I am done... maybe exercise (that is not a big deal to me, it is more of a habit now anyways), but otherwise I just cannot function.I was supposed to be productive because weed was making me guilty for not improving my life, which needs it... but now I am not doing anything and I am completely sober. That depression is hitting hard again and I am trying to not numb it. I cannot say weed is a factor here, but I am thinking it is definitely one of them. Now I am feeling guilty again, but without the substance to block it out. I will not go back to drinking casually by myself (thank you green for helping, I admit that), but... shit man. Quitting green should not be this hard. I have cold turkey addy abuse before, and even then I was getting brain shocks from that, but those have ceased long ago thankfully. Scary shit.I cannot get out of my head that my 34 year old life can be fixed. I compare myself to everyone and just talk myself down about it to a terrible fault, but I just want to be happy and achieve my goals. Now I am back to scratching that spot on my head, dreading tomorrow.it is not like I am stupid... in some sense. Got the degree (yup, psych), dropped out of grad school, got a real estate license and personal training cert basically on a whim (both expired because I hate the selling). So I start and give up rather easily. My dream is to become an author. I know, overdone, but I cannot help it, I enjoy making a world and spooky stories and that is what makes it a dream, to at least live off that. Whenever I get someone to read something, I feel like I am forcing them to give me compliments, so now I have not touched my laptop (except for paying bills) in almost a year. I cannot continue this life in this state. In this state of having customers yell at me over the phone, constantly beating myself up, and knowing that tomorrow, I will not be able to improve. I would appreciate some input, or something nice? Ha. I am sure if you are reading this, you have an idea of why I am writing this. But it is not healthy. I take 20mg fluoxetine, but I cannot feel it. When I went up 40mg I felt terrible, so that is was not good. Anyways, thank you for letting me get this out. I cannot convince myself that my life will get better, and that is making me believe nothing is worth trying.",Depression

He then got out so walked after got close enough that I whistled and busted his knee and ankle and ran like hell. The only problem is that I like to much.

I am financially well off and feeling this way while being so privileged just makes me feel like such a waste of space. a waste of protons, brain waves, oxygen, food, water, money. I am a parasite. if I write a will stating that i need my money to go to several orgs and then off myself, would that work? Or should i send all of it off first? Idk how much longer i can wait.6 months ago I felt good and like i had grown from my first attempt. I have drive to go back to school and to make friends and be happy. Looking back I feel like that version of me was like paper, so unstable and so unaware of how simple minded i was. Then I met someone and fell in love. I have never wanted to marry someone and spend my life with someone before. and he hates me. he makes me hurt on purpose and yells at me to overwhelm me. he talks down to me and asks me why things are so hard for me to understand. but I am really starting to think its just my fault. I kind of deserve it. No one else would deserve it, but I do. I am autistic, so maybe i am just really stupid. maybe i provoke him every time without realizing or trying. maybe I am just especially annoying and awful to be around. I feel like I do not belong anywhere. Nobody wants me. I do not have any friends because i stopped texting them back. I do not have the energy to make new friends. I rarely go outside because I feel like I am in everyone is way. I miss my dogs. I just want a hug. I am so beyond tired and I have been looking for ways to do it but i cannot figure out what to do. I do not want to scar anyone or hurt anyone. I just want to go away and disappear. I was never meant to be on this planet in the first place. I was curious about how to get to the roof of a really tall building in the city closest to me, but maybe i would just be arrested for trespassing if i tried to split off from a tour and find my way up there? i want my mind to stop working and to end the stream of my consciousness and knowledge of my own personality and existence as soon as possible. i am truly alone and undeserving",Suicidal
"Its not easy wearing a mask all the time. Sometimes I carry it well, other times I cannot even find the strength to put it on. Everything is fine as long as I wear it but the minute it starts to slip I am no fun to be around, I cannot even open up about the way I truly feel because nobody really understands. I do not enjoy doing anything. Literally. I am just on autopilot, in a constant state of numbness. Its like I am just a ball and chain for my wife to carry around. Of course she is tired of it, who would not be. She does not understand the constant pain I am in. She does not understand that she is the only reason I am even keeping on going. Opening up to her just causes her pain because I know she just wants me to be happy with her. The thing is though, I would not be anywhere as happy as I am now without her. she is my world. I just do not know what to do. I feel guilty for her having to be around me like this. I feel like I have to wear a mask all the time",Depression

"I think I am going to kill myself tonightI've been living with mental issues since about middle school. Mainly, being depressed and having a lot of issues with who I am/how I look. The only time that I started accepting myself was when I was in a relationship and had someone there to remind me that at least they thought I was attractive, and that was all that mattered. However, my insecurities eventually got the best of me and I became toxic and jealous, which led to the end of the relationship several months ago.I deserved that, and she deserved better. I know that I hurt her a lot, and I have trouble living with that. It also reduces my self image further, to where I have trouble living with myself in general. I think I was incredibly lucky to have been in a relationship with someone like that, and I do not think it will happen again. I do not want it to happen again, because I know it would end the same way. I have been in therapy and help groups since the break up trying to deal with myself and be a better person, but I have not noticed any improvement.I think at this point I am just a burden and holding the people around me back. I am always bringing up my issues and wanting to deal with them, but it is just at a point now where no one wants to see me anymore because of that. I am also scared of them seeing that toxic part of me that I am having trouble changing and leaving me.I feel bad that people will be hurt by this, but I hope that they will be able to move on quickly. Someone always loses in a fight",Suicidal

"I am sick of feeling this shit. I do not need people to keep telling me how to fix my problems, advocating happiness, you will get through this. I am not a kid who needs to be consoled. We all know the realities of life. it is going to be shit and some things will get better but we will have bad career days, bad relationships, bad health, bad finances, things will go wrong. And there is already enough wrong. The road to get to even stable is insurmountable and then to happiness on top of that.. imagining that that is possible or could possibly be worth the struggle is just ridiculous.. I want to die. I live such a passive life, I have no ambition to live, have a career, marry or have children. I studied, I graduated, I had relationships, I shopped, I had friends, I traveled.. I am done, there is nothing I want to do and there is so much pain and all I can think to make me happy is to die and no one will ever understand that this is not a cry for help it is just me reaching my end before society tells us we are supposed to. I am fine with dying, I am not scared or impulsive or immature. I just have nothing left to give and nothing to take from the world anymore. I want to stop.

"I am a 17(f) Lately I have been feeling more and more depressed, I look back at my old self and how I used to be when I was younger. I used to be filled with life and always hang out with friends I had a good relationship with my family I would say that that was probably the best part of my life so far sadly:/I cannot even look at myself in the mirror I always avoid mirrors because I hate myself.Coming from a mexican household my mother does not believe in mental health problems. She always says ""you have food, clothes, and a roof over your head! Why are you sad? You should be grateful for all the things you have.""My parents are divorced, I have 3 siblings but the oldest left to live on their own. My oldest brother had a huge argument with my mom and they have not spoken/seen each other for four years. I also have a 2nd oldest brother who has Autism, he is also mute and he pretty much needs help with everything. he is pretty calm and does not look like he has special needs, but he makes noises which annoys me and I feel bad for being embarrassed/annoyed with him. Right now I am living in an apartment with my mother and Autistic brother. My mom has to work 24/7 so that means that I have to look after my brother which feels like a full time job. I can never go out without bringing him along because I cannot leave him alone I am already embarrassed by him so I cannot even go out. I feel like even if I wanted to move out I could not because I have no money and I have no opportunity to go and make money for myself. My father is also pretty absent in my life:/I also have no friends because my best friend of 8 years and my friend group decides to exclude me out. I was bullied by them my sophomore year.I feel like I am stuck, everyday is the same. I do not see a reason that I should keep waking up everyday. I am not pretty or skinny so that does not help either. I just want to pause my life and breathe and to go be able to do the things I want to do but I cannot. I imagine that I will be my brother's guardian once my mom passes away. she is healthy now but I do not want to be responsible for him but I do at the same time because I feel bad.

"You cannot break facts. My life is going to be a mess and I see it. I am afraid of it. Combined with all the other things my life fucked. Socially, my personality is weird. The chance of getting ignored is high. I am afraid of it. I really hate it when I indicate that I am suicidal and everyone takes it as a joke or just ignores it. I tried again and again. Nah. Cut people off and no active social interaction at all. it is much better than saying ""I am not okay"" and getting ignored. I do not have any feelings. All are gone.

"Hi, I am new to Reddit and this is my first vent post, so this might be a little long and all over the place. I just wanted to rant about some things I have been feeling lately. Any nice comments would be appreciated. I am a sophomore in college and a student athlete, my sport being swimming. My first year was the worst I have ever performed and I am scared that Ill never amount to anything. I feel like I am steadily declining and losing the only thing I have been successful at my whole life. I used to be really great at what I do and really respected, and now I am fucking pathetic. All of my efforts each day do not do shit and I have not improved or made any progress at all. If I cannot do well at something I literally dedicate my entire life to, all that tells me is that Ill never be good at anything and Ill just be mediocre my whole life. Nothing special. A worthless, pathetic loser. I just want to die, but I know Id never actually have the guts to kill myself. It feels like suicidal thoughts are always in my head though. I have tried hurting myself recently but I was too afraid to go any further. I am so obsessed with my weight and I cannot look in the mirror without wanting to rip myself apart. I fucking hate myself. So much shit is going on in my head that I cannot even begin to try and deal with it, so I spend most of my time laying in bed consuming 5 different forms of media at the same time so I do not have any time to think. there is so much going on and so much I feel is wrong with me but I do not really know what it is. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I feel like the shit I deal with is more than that. But my whole life my parents would always tell me that I overreact about everything and that I just needed to toughen up and be a big girl. I cannot even trust myself and my own feelings anymore. I do not understand anything and I am so tired of my mind being like this. I do not know what to do or how to help myself anymore. I just want to give up. I feel stuck in this deep hole and have no hope of getting myself out of it.",Depression
Mine is just I am a bit too scared to go through with it rn what is the thing that is stopping you from committing suicide?,Suicidal
"Hello. I have read alot of people on here(suicide and depression groups) who actually encourage suicide and that is never okay. I am not wanting people who can relate to these feelings but rather hoping someone who is online is an advocate or something who can give me hope. I am in a very bad/dark mindset and I am contemplating suicide. I have been for over a month but tonight I am truly having the mindset to go forth. I have a legit(to **ME**) reason as to why I am contemplating. I do not want to go into details on here as I got hate earlier for reaching out with my reasoning. I was told I was pathetic and ridiculous for wanting to end my life over said reason and was told to get over it and move on when I strictly asked for that not to do be mentioned.The suicide hotline is not cutting it... it makes me uncomfortable. I want to be able to talk about my issues but I cannot as I have no one. The one person I did have.... is gone and now I am like this... Alone and contemplating ending it all.(get help seek a doctor seek meds move on get over it quit relying on someone else for happiness time heals etc) are all things I do not need to hear. They make matters worse. they are cliche and there is a reason why therapists avoid using those.One, I am seeking help on here. Two, I reached out to a new therapist. Three, I do not like meds. Four, I cannot move on or get over my situation. Five, I do not rely on someone else for happiness they just so happened to be the only shred of happiness I had in life. Six, time does not heal. Sometimes time will because things to fade to a certain extent... but it is not that way for EVERYONE. If time healed and people got over everything(cliche) this group would not exist. Suicide would not exist. So to be as short as I can. I am going through the biggest/worst event of my life. I am alone. I am sad. I am heartbroken. I have no one and I mean that. Family told me to ""either kill yourself or shut the hell up I am tired of hearing crying and about you being sad."" I do not get out of my house much. I am an introvert with super bad IBS who is scared of everything... literally. So no I do not have any friends. I *had* one true person in life. Anyways, I have gone through death. Watched some of the closest people to me die awful death's. The worst being a death brought on by cancer. Watched her deteriorate after the diagnosis-radiation and chemo, and within a year of diagnosis she died in hospice. Last moments with her she was not there. She was so doped up on pain meds she could not talk and did not know who we were. And STILL this pain I am facing now as awful as that sounds.... does not even begin to amount to this pain I am feeling now. I am wanting to end my life. I can end my life so easily right now but a small piece of me wants to hang on or I would not be on here. Sure it is sad and pathetic I am on here for help but it is HERE FOR A REASON because some people still care about others in life even if it is strangers. Is there a safe video chat or some kind of chat(not suicide hotline-convos too short) that does not have a time limit? If not, I just need hope. I need to hear that there is always hope. I know you do not know what my situation is or why I am asking for hope, but if it is true, my situation does not matter. There IS hope. I need just a small amount. Just a tad so I can NOT go over the edge. I want to talk about why I am feeling this way SO BAD but I know I will get hate... even if it is one person out of 10 or so. Someone is going to give me hate and make me feel more like shit or they are going to say the one thing's I have said I cannot bare to hear anymore. Please... anyone? Hope. I am alone and broken... Is there anyone who is an advocate online? Actively feeling suicidal",Suicidal
"So I have been feeling this way for, well ages. After a few life changing moments a few years ago I suddenly actually want to stay. A few things kind of magically fell into place for me which made life not seem so bad. do not get me wrong. I absolutely still have those heavy dark days that feel like it will never pass. I am fighting my best fight but I have recently noticed I am slipping back into old habits. For example, I have that nagging feeling that I am just not good enough unless I work myself to the bone, even picking up a second job in the process, and if I do not then I am worthless and not worthy of love. I have resorted to needing sleep aids to have a regular sleep schedule just to be able to keep myself functioning to work 12 hour days 6 days a week. A lot to unpack there but I am kind of ignoring it for now. Today was an ok day, but a coworker who came in for shift change complained loudly and angrily to another coworker near me about how poorly closing was the night before. Small things like securing lids on produce and closing bread bags were missed. I closed last night and of course it was a bad night for me where everything is a blur and my memory is shot so then I began to list off in my head what I did and what I must have forgotten. I became even more upset upon hearing them complain about seeing me and other closers off the clock relaxing at the bar (I work at a tavern) and how no one should have clocked out without a proper walk through. It just so happened to be my birthday which my coworkers found out about and I stayed for a single drink out of feeling obligated to celebrate and I NEVER stay after for a drink because I feel so uncomfortable in social situations. I was close to tears as I hurried to finish up and clock out this afternoon. Am I taking his outburst as validation for how awful I already feel about myself or was my reaction appropriate? Me forgetting something at closing when I am normally very diligent about completing tasks correctly is horrifying for me and now I never want to clock out early again even though my manager let me leave early last night. I just need a little help navigating this situation and how to handle it when my boss confronts me about it next time I clock in, which they definitely will because the complaining coworker has lead to confrontations with my boss in the past. I want to never have to clock in again. I am terrified. Need help navigating uncertainty",Depression

"It makes me laugh, in a half-shocked-half-depressed kind of way, that the common discourse around depression is still that it is an individual problem.For when the way that we live is so drastically different from how we evolved, it is not hard to see why our minds may create some friction. We live disconnected from anything meaningful: work, relationships, nature, but above all, meaning itself. Anyone who refuses to accept that the meaning of life is to work for money and possessions is sick in the head, disturbed, mentally ill.Your body uses pain to tell you that your current situation is dangerously off. Then, is depression not your mind telling you that something needs to change? And if so, how sick is it to try to change the mind itself, to try to convince it that no, pain is actually fine, there is nothing wrong. Our minds are trying to tell us that we are not meant to live this way, that there IS something greater to experience in life than sleepwalking through every dull day, collecting our checks so that we can pretend to have fun for a few hours each weekend. Our minds are trying to get us outside, into nature, to find friends and do real, meaningful activities with them, to get away from all the stress, anger, and jealousy of the cities and return to how we were meant to live. A simple life, with meaningful work, meaningful goals, meaningful friendships, but above all, a way to find meaning in every action, to feel like there is a reason to live.There is something better. We do not have to live like this. We are not meant to live like this",Depression

The only thing keeping me from doing it is the thought of my baby brother asking where I was. I just cannot handle it.

"I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes and other errors i will probably make.Well the post title is just that, living is fun and all sometimes but i just cannot handle it anymore. No matter what i try, i either end up hurting myself more in the progress or failing miserably from the beginning.I applied for roughly 30 jobs in the last two months and almost got rejected from everyone because i had a burnout in my senior year due to my teacher and my sister moving out. And the ones where I actually managed to get an interview quickly shut me down because i got self harm scars from when i was younger.And ofc the only way i know how to get rid of this shit is either SH or drowning out my sorrows in videogames and just pretending it did never happen.But that is not the part that makes me not be alive anymore, i got an emotionally abusive mother and an physical abbusive father, the occasional kick or punch i can deal with, but it my mother who really hurts me. Every single time something is missing in the house, Dosent matter what it is. I get accused of taking it, eating it, or having it last and thus loosing it. Followed up by a verbal assault of what a disappointment i am, how useless i am and how she sometimes wishes she would have aborted me.I often considered running away atleast to a friend or atleast the unemployment office to get away from here. But the last time i brought up living with a friend for a month she ran into my parents room threatening to kill herself if i moved away.In the last couple of weeks it has been extra rough for me idk why, but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. Like rn i just lay in bed trying to fall asleep but just cannot and keep doing stuff to drown out the memories of my best friend simply using me to get closer to crush to date her and then botch ditching me.Another friend of mine just using me for money because she knew i needed someone and that i would buy her things just to not leave me alone again.Seeing my best friend since middle school slowly getting addicted to drugs until he killed himself.My first gf cheating on me and even afterwards telling me how good it felt.And tbh the thing that hurts the most is Hannah, she was a friend of my GF and me at the time, and when shit hit the fan she was there for me, i cried so fucking much during that time and she was there for me, i tried to be the best friend i could at that time cheering her up even though I was fucked myself. But apparently i did not do good enough of a job""It would be better for all of us if you finally killed yourself"" That still sticks with me today, i think about it every single time i get closer to someone, every time i talk to a friend. That maybe they all think so and she was right, that i should stop beeing such a pussy and finally kill myself.Its funny that i kept this to almost last tbh, maybe its because i do not really want to talk about it, or because it happened at such a young age that is its practicaly a part of me at this point, when i was i think 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by an older classmate i think 11 or 12 I am sorry for the numbers.At first it Started out as playing, then someday he just undressed and acted like nothing was wrong, and suggested we play doctors and such idk what is he called it I am sorry. Idk it just kind of happened and then stopped someday when he switched schools. I cannot have a bodily relationship with anyone, if someone hugs me without asking and telling me beforehand i get panic attacks, when i layed in bed once with a friend of mine i had to get up because i just could not stay next to bed in ber and feel scared.I just do not want to live with all this fucking baggage anymore, every single day seems to get worse and worse. And there is nothing i can do about it.I am sorry if you read this, you should not have but i just needed somewhere to write this downI just do not want all this fucking baggage Sometimes i just do not want to live anymore, or atleast not as myself.",Depression

"I was given emergency surgery to repair testicular torsion back in 2017 and to this day I believe the surgery was botched in some way. I get frequent spells of extreme testicular pain that resonates throughout my lower abdomen. Not a minor annoyance either, pain so bad I sometimes have to go to the ER because I have reason to believe it is another torsion. Tonight makes the fifth trip to the ER with nothing wrong and no treatment given, along with several urologists throughout the years. Now, I am trans and am interested in an orchiectomy for both medical reasons and dysphoria. However, I still do not know *for sure* if my testicles are the issue. I have seen several hypotheses given through the years, ranging from bladder infections to just really, really bad cases of ""blue balls."" If my orchiectomy happens (my consultation is in early-August) and this mysterious chronic pain persists, I have no choice but to eat buckshot. I cannot take it anymore and this surgery is my last hope. These periods of intense pain have cost me a job, they have cost me social opportunities, and they have cost my family a fortune in American medical bills. Because of this, I feel horrifically guilty for constantly needing to go to the ER and having no diagnosis or treatment to show for it. While they are very understanding and thoroughly supportive, I cannot shake the intrusive thought that they are annoyed and think I am just being a hypochondriac.As I write this, I am stoned off my ass. I use cannabis to cope because I do not know what else to do. I am not enjoying this high right now either, because I am still in a fair amount of pain. The ER sometimes sends me home with prescriptions for opiates, but I have seen what those do to people and refuse to let myself use them, because I know I will become physically, and eventually psychologically, addicted to them. I do not use alcohol to cope either because it is also incredibly dangerous to rely on for chronic pain relief. I am 100% banking on this surgery. If this inexplicable pain returns post-recovery, I am not sure I will be able to take it any longer. If I were a cis man, I would have probably killed myself after three years of this. My orchiectomy is my last chance to live a pain-free life.",Suicidal
"I was heavily considering killing myself in December 2019, and honestly, the idea was never completely out of my head prior to that either. I wish I did. I wish every single day that I did.Things were finally getting better and I had just received a handful of amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities the week before the pandemic officially started a you.S. lockdown. I had one week. Just one week that I did not think about dying every single morning and every single night.Everything has been hell. I lost my apartment and had to move home because the person I moved in with went absolutely insane and had a total breakdown and started aggressively forcing me to live by her conspiracy theory rules. (Covid is spread via the sidewalk, covid is spread via open windows in the air two stories up, the windows needed to be boarded up, never once leaving the apartment in a year, etc.)Covid is a completely different experience for those who have significant others and a stable living situation. I had neither. I tried so hard to go on dating sites so I would not be completely alone. But people would lovebomb me and then when I was invested they would start being abusive and degrading and cruel. I gave up.It feels like women genuinely do not care about anything other than their boyfriends no matter how progressive or new age they are. All of my female friends revolved their entire lives around their boyfriends since the pandemic started, and honestly before that too.I hate being home. I despise it. But I social distanced as much as possible. I was guilted or shamed by people for going out, and guilted and shamed by people for staying in. It felt like all my female friends would always justify that they constantly visited their boyfriends, or spent all their time with their boyfriends. But if I ever saw a friend once a month, it was frowned upon.Why? Why is it so taboo and wrong for me to be social just because it was not with someone who I was fucking.My friends all made me realize that it is impossible to ever get structure unless I somehow manage to find a significant other. But I have tried so hard to date and almost every time has been a traumatic experience.I am so jealous of them. I hate them. I do not want to hate my friends. But I feel so angry. I feel so misunderstood. Absolutely NONE of the people who judged me would ever go through what I went through.I moved back home with my parents from a huge city to a town with 800 people. My parents, I love very much but they are both abusive. I did not have a choice. I had to leave my apartment because my roommate had stopped working and paying rent. I would have had to pay the entire 2 bedroom rent if I stayed.I feel like a burden. I wish I had just died. there is no place for me in this world. I have not been happy in two years. I lost everything. I will never have a life that is rewarded in a pandemic. I am not meant to be happy &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I will only ever destroy my life and I do not deserve happiness I wish I killed myself before the pandemic",Suicidal

"I do not know anymore. I just cannot feel happy or anything good, I am always sad and I am constantly telling myself that I *should* be happy. I am doing the things that used to make me happy, but I just feel empty. And then this compared to some of the shit my friends go through, like my friend who is dad started another family whilst still being married to his mom, and he can persist, I, on the other hand, cannot persist after anything negative. And by anything negative it could literally be me listening to some of the music I like (a band I enjoy listening to has some very odd music and if I am feeling some way I can be sent into an episode of sort, ending in me either hurting myself or crying for hours on end, or having to lean on somebody, and that option has been completely scratched off so its only two ig). I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for quite some time, I just do not see the need to keep pointlessly wade through pain for a mediocre at best experience. I probably hurt myself maybe once or twice a month, usually just like cutting myself on the thigh. I honestly do not think Id be missed when/if I go. My parents want absolutely nothing to do with me, probably because I am a dead beat who cannot get shit done, and when it comes to graded I am like a B student. And then I have like two actual friends, one of which I can barely talk to because her parents strongly dislike me because I would always have to lean on her for support, and she was the only person who could help me while being willing to help me. But apparently I was putting too much pressure on her so I am only allowed to talk to her whenever her parents are around. And my other friend just does not understand what I go through. Anyways I am sorry for whoever read that and idk i do not think I am in direct threat to a suicide (I might like cut myself later though) and I am sorry for wasting your guys time. I just want help and I am sorry because Ill be no help to anyone trying to help me because I do not even know what is wrong, ig it comes back to probably my favorite lyric someone help me understand what is going on inside my mind.

Every second of the day I am on the edge of having a panic attack (I had my first last year in November) it felt like I was going crazy and words did not make sense I felt this fear over come my body I felt as if I was seeing the world through a phone and I did not feel present if that makes sense. I suffer with really bad social anxiety but during my panic attack I wanted to run up to random people and ask this if everything was going to be okay and to make sure I was fine. I got lightheaded because of the terror in my body and my hands and legs were going cold and numb. I seriously wanted to die during it all it lasted about 20 minutes and then calmed down a bit to where I could at least keep myself fighting to want to live. I have not had a full blown panic attack like that again but ever since I know the feeling I have this fear of having it again and will get random waves of that anxiety I had before I had my panic attack which just makes me freak out more. I do not want to self diagnose so I am just going to say I have this intrusive thoughts that I am becoming schizophrenic 24/7 so the most random things will trigger me that never did before and I obsess over it 1000 times after that questioning why it did and come to the conclusion I am losing it.

"Yesterday I was on Muni and I was smoking cigar like I normally do meanwhile a guy across from me is blast gangsta rap. About 3 mins in of smoking I was good. Then the dude blasting gangsta rap starts complaining ""Put that shit out!"" I am like ""No."" he is all "" I hate rats like you it stinks, and broke is all you will ever be!"" ""I am like but you blastin music."" he is all ""You irritating more ppl than me, now I turned it down, now put yours out."" I am like ""No"" Then he snitches to bus driver and I call him a snicth. Then he is all the like ""your Mama's a snitch"" meanwhile I put it out and he turns back up the gangsta rap and starts rapping obnoxiously. Then bus driver starts threatening to kick me off and bout a fucking mask. So I put on a scarf. We eventually all get kicked off for me smoking and the gangsta rap. Moral is everyone want listen to gangsta rap but nobody can do gangsta shit. they talk the talk but cannot walk the walk. Nobody can handle the reality of it. Everytime somebody does she me gangsta shit someone winds up snitching, wining or going against it. Everyone claims to be from the hood, wears gangsta clothing: baggy pants,Jordans cortezes, white tee and gold teeth but nobody can handle the lifestyle. I am a rebel, outlaw, I do shit that goes against the law and IDGAF I do not dress like a gangsta and do not claim to be one but I hate people so fuck them. I am always smoking on bus I never where a mask and I I play my loud ass music. But do I complain when others do the same? No. I always get kicked off the bus and will continue too. This cognitive dissonance of the American gangsta drives me insane Everybody listens to gangsta rap but will not do gangsta shit",Suicidal
"My brother was diagnosed with MDD w/ to psychotic features over a month ago. Despite having anti-psychotic meds and a therapist he only seems to be getting worse. Its only me, my mom, and him. The pressure is literally crushing my mom. He refuses to be open with anyone other than his girlfriend, who has her own shit to deal with. He gets angry when my mom tries to check on him when hes spiraling, almost to the point where I am scared to talk to him. We wake up to him banging on his walls so loud that my room shakes. We ask him what is going on and he either ignores us or says hes fine. His therapists will not talk to us without his permission, which is understandable. We cannot afford for him to see a psychiatrist regularly and not many take his insurance. I feel like all we can do is watch himself worse and idk what to do. How do I help my brother who is struggling with MDD?",Depression

"So, I am a few months shy of 21, I have been struggling with depression since I was 14 and, right now, my life has gone through some drastic changes that have affected my mental health. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in medicine (I used to be a nursing student, now I am seeking medical school) and that, associated with quarantine, made me spend a lot of time home.Because of this, I have been dealing with constant homophobia by my family, especially my father and brother and more unrequested comments about everything I do. This has led my down a darker path, I have stopped studying, running (I was a marathonist), gained 20kg from anxiety eating, and I barely brush my teeth. I have gone back to self-harming pretty much every day after being clean for 4 months and have planned to take my own life on August 1st, even wrote my goodbyes to my family and my girlfriend. I want to get help, I know I am not okay and just found out my insurance covers psychiatric interventions (yayyy) but I am a bit scared to go there since I, during psych rotations in nursing school, I dealt with some pretty scary situations. I would love some insight about what it is like in there and here your thought about itThanks in advance, have a wonderful day Has anyone here ever been to a psych ward? If so, what is it like?",Depression

"Hello fellow redditors!First of all stay strong and keep fighting I have been taking antidepressants (escitaloprame) during my episode of major depression for about 4 months. Now that I am doing better I am going off the meds. By now I do not take any of those. While the antidepressants originally gave me sleeping issues I am starting to notice something that others probably would not consider a problem: I often wake up after 4-5 hours of sleep, not even being tired. I have never had so little sleep without further impact, the lowest amount I have had before when I was relaxed has been around 6 hours.I know that there is a little chance to have specific genes that allow low amount of sleep. However I wondered if my observations might be due to antidepressants changing the brain activity in the long run.Have any of you had similiar experience with sleeping quality after going off antidepressants?PS: I suspect that I have had dysthymia through my whole life with some depression episodes inbetween so maybe my sleep quality increased because I am finally fine - something that I wish for every single one of you!

"Honestly, not even sure what I want to say. Kind of just want to let people know about motherhood and clinical depression. Not post-partum depression. I have struggled with self-hate ever since I was kid. I believe that nobody could, can, or ever will love me, including myself. There just really is not much to like. Not soon after it became depression and I have just lived my life like this. I am married and have 2 kids. Just want to quickly say that depression is different from being depressed. Being depressed (as my doctor explained) is usually from outward influences. Depression is pretty much a neurological disorder that can be caused through trauma and the like. But yeah, it does not get better with time like everybody says, I have been waiting for a while for that miraculous day to come. Really, I have no idea what I want to say. I guess if you struggle with depression, please get help before getting into a serious relationship or having children. You may think that those things will help you (I did) but they do not. Instead you are family becomes almost an excuse for you to push yourself over the limit. Anyway, I recently reached out and told my doctor and have been put in touch with a psychiatrist. It was hard to tell somebody as the only person who sort of knows is my husband. And I am legit scared to see a psychiatrist and talk about it again, but I am waging a war with myself. Get help or disappear before my 2 year old is able to remember anything about me. Personally the latter seems like the better option but then I think about what it would do to him in the future. Would he really think I loved him and did it for him, or would he think that it was his fault and that he was the problem? So I am getting help instead. There is so much more I want to say about having depression and being a mother, but it will literally be a book and nobody wants to read that, so yeah. It sucks, but get help.

"Just to clarify, **I have never told anyone that I have wanted to die because of them, and I will never do something that in my life.**But... What I have done, having realized that yesterday, is something **very** selfish...In the past years, I used to tell some of the closest friends I have ever had about my feelings of suicide, like I felt sad, empty or than I wanted to catch the bus, including a time I engaged into self-harm once or twice, **(but I never told them it was because of them or something similar).** I also told the same things to people I used to know from the internet...What I did... Is **unforgivable.**I put such a huge **burden on them**, I think I made them feel they were responsible for my happiness... Even if that was not my intention, even if I tried to reciprocate things to them as much as I could; the **damage** was done.Those things should only be told either to qualified mental health professionals with decades of study, or in anonymous forums with people who have similar problems, but either the anonymity or professional relationship have boundaries to ensure the person who listens will not end up feeling guilty or responsible.Maybe that is the main reason I ended up being mostly alone... Even if I was desperate for help, I asked for it in the most horrible way I could have ever done...They moved on because they deserved to be happy, they deserved to be surrounded with positive people who love them, they deserved all the good things in the world...Something that a useless, toxic and cowardly person like me would never be able to provide... Even if I was hurt a lot, even if society ended up betraying me, I should have never asked that kind of advice to them... Honestly... I do not think I have ever been a good person at all... Ever since I was a child I have had trouble connecting with people, my way of being (like how I speak, walk and express myself), pissed them off so much that they ended up bullying me as punishment, or they slowly ignored me until I got the message and moved away from their lives.Heh, and I thought I could be a hero... What kind of hero does that?What kind of **decent** human being does something like that?Like someone told me once, even if I never had bad intentions towards them, my **final actions** were the ones that mattered the most.Aristotle said that there are friendships based either on affinity, utility and true love...Aside from some exceptions, I think most of the friendships I have ever had in my life were about utility and affinity, with very few ones based on true love...And if deep inside my core I am not a good person, it explains why I have to suffer like this as punishment. I think I have been a manipulator...",Suicidal
"Hi guys I am a 18F and I feel like I am falling back into a state of depression. I feel like part of it is because it is summer break so I feel like I have nothing productive to do. Throughout the day I am just in a constant state of sadness although idk if it would be considered depression. I sometimes find myself thinking about death even though I am not necessarily suicidal. I do not really have the motivation to do anything productive and just laze around all day until its night time when I usually play games with my friends. This gives me some joy but then after it is done I fall back into that sad state. I feel like I have no one to talk to because I feel like I do not deserve to be depressed or sad. I do not have any financial struggles and I have a pretty good relationship with family and friends. I am hoping that once fall semester starts I will be out of this rut and instead be stressed about school LOL. Anyways, thank you to anyone that actually reads this and listened to my rant :).

"Below me the oceans waves crashed into the rocks. The ocean stretched out as far as the eyes could see, the artwork of God that makes real life seem like a dream.It was almost 6pm, the sun was setting and it painted a beautiful shade of orange on the oceans surface. A sunset is one of the most beautiful sights you could ever witness. However, the sun setting above the ocean its beauty can barely be described. I was standing on a cliff above the ocean, about 10 feet from the edge. My mind and body was sending waves of warnings about the dangers that awaited if I went any closer. Danger ahead it whispered, your safer here. The human brain has an unprecedented instinct for survival. I took a few steps forward and the warnings multiplied. Stop fucking walking the voice screamed. I was three feet closer to the edge of the cliff now and I could truly see the whole ocean ahead of me. I took sometime to bask in its beauty. I was standing still so the voice dwindled but still conspicuously whispered go fucking back.I involuntarily began reminiscing on the tragedy that is my past. The pain and agony inflicted on me by the world, the hell I went through in the hands of others, the betrayals from those I trusted, my regrets, the ones I have lost, the embarrassments, and humiliations I endured and most especially the catastrophes I personally inflicted upon myself and those I love due to my slavery to my desires and greed.The rest, I could find ways to cope with because the malevolence of the world and the human-beings that run it is not obscure, except to the hopelessly naive (which I was a part of for the longest time). I found it most onerous however to handle the last one for one simple reason; its one thing to be going through rejection, torment and suffering and its another thing to go through these things with the irrefutable knowledge that you are responsible for majority, if not all of it. Agony that is your fault is a special type of pain.I took more steps forward and my brain fired into overdrive survival mode. It was shrieking at me at this point. Its words incoherent but its meaning crystal clear.Death is close.Shockwaves of fear and terror flowed through me from head to toe and all I could perceive was the 50 feet drop into a belligerent ocean that crashed steadfastly into a bunch of jagged rocks, its thunderous boom promised to pull me into the everlasting warmth of oblivion if I fell, where my body would probably never be found.I was at the edge of the cliff now and my whole life had flashed through my eyes. Then I heard those words. I am seeing someoneThe phrase that drove me over the deep edge. The phrase that represented the coalescence of all my ignorant, vacuous, naive, selfish, greedy and gullible decisions.I still remember exactly how those words made me feel.Standing on the edge of the cliff with every molecule of my body screaming for me to turn back, I realized an important, simple fact.The pain and tragedy of my past and present just has to feel more overwhelming than my fear of demise to make turning back to my reality feel more painful than taking one more step. Standing on the edge of this cliff I deeply understood this feeling. I am in so much pain, I feel so alone all the time even when I am around those who love me so dearly. I do not understand how to make things better. I do not know if things will ever get better. So far its gone from bad to worse to agonizing and I do not know how to bear these feelings anymore. Nothing indicates that things will get better. Signs keep pointing to things getting worse. I feel so tired of being me and it feels easier to just take one more step.I turned back and walked away, for my family, who have loved me far more than I have ever loved myself. I know a lot of us on here are struggling. I wrote a short prose, I hope it gives someone solace.",Suicidal
"sorry I am really close to just giving up everything.. all of the abuse I have endured this far makes me constantly wonder if i deserved it. I have always been a caring person and I have always been as nice as i can be but the world just constantly throws it back in my face. growing up with r\*pe, sexual and emotional abuse for years from my stepfather (and physical abuse from his romantic interests) alongside the murder? suicide? of my mom, i do not even know anymore what happened to herand that is hurting too. I am tired. i do not know if ""things will get better"" is true at all. I am 22 now and nothing has gotten better. all of the family that might have cared for me are dead now or i just do not talk to them because they have all of their own problems, not like a lot of them had ever gone through the effort to talk or help me anyways. its always been me, until foster care stepped in. cannot even mention the shittiness of that. my only escape used to be the internet, but at this point its less of an escape and just too much for me now toothere are little things in life i love, like my pets and my fiance and my friends, but i do not think i can make it any further in life. i do not want to drag them down with me while I am running out of money and literally deterriorating in front of my fiance, though i know I have already impacted his health. does not matter how much i try my best to be the best for him, I am just not good. the only ways i can function even just slightly is if I am high on anything. I have tried hard not to get into alcohol or do anything that might harm my body but i already have it pretty bad there anyways so i do not even know if its worth tryign to preserve myself at all. all i ever got told growing up from people who cared is that I am strong for living through what i did but it is too hard to get over those things when they impede my daily living constantly. i cannot go outside or i have terrible anxiety attacks, cannot work for the same reason. i can hardly buy groceries without either being in too much pain or suffering from these anxiety issues. needless to say the ptsd and insomnia make sleep almost impssible to come by and not at all refreshing. even just writing this reminds me that i just have too many problems and not a single solution for them has worked and I am tired of trying to fix things, using energy i do not have to do these things and try to live i just want to sleep and never wake up or maybe ill go on a walk and get hit by a car and die or something with my luck.

"I have been having depression and anxiety from studying. As a student I have always tried to get the best grades possible with that i was not getting recognition from my family but was still determined to aim higher the year later i started high school with a 93 average and ended with 98 average totaling it up to 96.3. I have always thought that when i get these grades i would get a good job or congratulations from my parents but i was fully depressed when i told them about my final term grade and did not even get a good job or atta-boy which really affected me negatively and i was so sad that i had to confront my mother about this and we started crying and she said she would do better and thankfully it worked but it still lies in the back of my head wether or not if i had said this when my final grades are up she would appreciate or was my confrontation a wake up call to start appreciating me. Even my siblings notice the abandonment i get relating to my studies, where it has caused me to try and aim for the high not to be the best just to be appreciated by my parents.After all that was done in my country there are limited scholarships a person could apply to and with my grades i thought I could have easily got one and by this time i would have choices to pick from but because of covid my grades were insignificant because many students got their grades up by cheating. And there is one month left and I am still anxious if ill get the scholarship i desire and this has trully ruined my mood over the holidays and made me not care about many things i just would not bother to do anything it has been a long tire full journey of studying and not to get appreciated from anyone makes me depressed and starting to not even care about the foundation that i have built i studied and worked hard to excell at every part possible but i could not get the recognition i deserved either from my parents or the scholarships Trauma with studies",Depression
"I do not know why I am posting this, especially on my main account, whether it is to find comfort with potentially like-minded people, to just throw it out into the anonymous void that is the internet, or just to vent further but I truly feel in my heart if I had a gun or maybe a rope, just some means where I KNOW I would be dead while also not risking the lives of other people like I potentially would be if I jumped off the nearest bridge, I would be gone. My urge is strong, stronger than it is ever been, I feel hopeless and unable to get help, but I have also failed enough in life and the last thing I want to do is fail at ending it too.I used the Lifeline Chat, and I know some people have had bad experiences with both the hotline and the chat, but I do think the person I got was trying to help as best they could, and maybe I will try to use the resources they presented me with to try and get on the road to recovery, I just do not know what that road even is anymore nor where it might take me.I guess the Sticky Notes version of my life is: Grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional family. Mom died young, after I graduated, and it messed me up, Dad developed Dementia and I was essentially forced to take care of him with little support until I finally broke down and he had to go to a nursing home. Pretty isolated from the rest of the family with few remaining friends. I was in a good position at work I guess but my life is literally my miserable job then nothing else meaningful and I am finding it harder to tough through my mental blocks and have been missing work, dying up my bank account and am close to homeless.

I promised I would not do it again, and now I just do not know what to do.I tried watching some YouTube, I tried smoking my vape. I would considering trying to play some games, but I will probably punch my laptop. If I go for a walk, I will end up punching a wall, and will make my work life harder, since I need hands. I even considered writing some poetry, but all that is coming to my head is FUUUCK I want to do something I will regret. cannot even jerk off, because I am porn free now, and if I use my imagination I would probably rip my dick off. So now I am sitting here, numb but feeling all of this at once. I am just scrolling reddit, not even reading the posts. I can barely feel my arms. I am considering going out and getting a 6pack, but I am afraid if I use it to cope once, I will use it to cope over and over again and I will end up a sad, lonely drunk, and then I will actually try to kill myself.I have got nothing right now, I cannot even talk to my friends about this, because there is secrets(not mine) they cannot know. Even if I talked to someone, they would probably not understand and try to twist things around, or argue what actually happened. I do not need that, I just need to feel better. My head is just so fucking noisy",Depression
"I do not get it. I do not get why i feel this way. I have a mom who loves me and who i love to death, a dad that cares about me. A sibling who looks up to me. I am 15 I have been going to therapy since last year.She said i got better, she said my aura had changed, she said i seem happier and that was true for some time but now i do not even know. I do good in school i have 3 friends who love me. Who i told that i hate myself. I am a white middle class girl who lives in a safe town. But yet i find my self crying for no reason. I find myself feeling numb and on the verge of breakdowns when hanging out with friends. I am terrified of death yet I want him to take my hand sooner than he has planned. I lay in bed and stare at my room that my mom begs for me to clean so desperately. She begs me to come downstairs and hangout with her yet i cannot and i feel so guilty for not doing so. My dad cried once because he realized he was too hard on me. I do not eat as much as i used to, a toddler could eat more than me in a day. The clothes on my back get changed when i take a shower which is a disgusting amount of days to some people. I read books wishing i was the main character, i would not have to worry about getting a shitty job that i hate just so i can become another employee to this company we call the you.S. The Earth is dying and there is nothing i can do about it. I want to live life to the fullest before the end but i cannot find myself having the energy or the funds to do so. I do not see a point to life the only thing stopping me is my mom walking in on my dead body. I cannot see my life being worth it in the long run, I cannot see the money my parents spend to feed and attempt to give me joy worth it. I do not get it i really do not get it i do not get why i have mascara stained cheeks right now. i do not get why two people decided to have sex one day. I do not get why I am drowning in my own misery while people have it worse. I remember in school we asked the question if a character in the book was weak or not for committing sucide. Every single person said weak. I do not see myself as a weak person and i do not think anyone who thinks about ending it is weak. I just think they want peace and they are tired. I am tired. Those few minutes of happiness a day are not worth the amount of dread i feel a week. I am young yet I am already exhausted",Depression

"As a child, I always told myself and people that I would be a French teacher. Not a dream job per se, but one supposedly reachable, right?At the beginning of high school, I decided to learn Swedish and fell completely in love with the language, the culture, the country as a whole. My goal to be a regular French teacher evolved and now I would absolutely love to become a French teacher in Sweden.But it feels doomed to failure and it is seriously eating me up.Why? Well, I stutter and have other speech issues. My stutter is not that terrible unless I am in a stress-inducing situation, there it can get pretty bad. Even worse, I tend to... dissociate (? I do not think this is the right word) after a bad stutter. This is a terrible thing to happen as a teacher, right?I am also anxious, have very low self-esteem and my social batteries run low most the time. What if it is too much work for my apathetic ass? What if I am not good enough? What if students do not like me? What if they make fun of my appearance? Of my stutter?My anxiety sadly comes with scopophobia. I was never able, in school, to stand up and go to the blackboard. I was never able to speak in front of other people. At the end of my second high school year, I had to give a presentation with a girl of my class in front of three unknown teachers. I broke down. The girl, and I thank her wholeheartedly for her kindess and attempt at comfort, had to hug me to calm me down (first time I was hugged or even touched ever since I was ten, when my pet bird died, so this hug really meant a lot to me). Being looked at, or just being noticeable, at best makes me uncomfortable, at worst makes me freak out.How am I supposed to be working as a teacher in those conditions? Am I fucking delusional to consider getting this job?Actually, I thought about working all alone in nature, something like that. Sadly, my academic profile is literature-oriented so I have a hard time finding a formation open to profiles like mine. Places are limited and usually very far from where I live. Either way, I am physically not in shape and have a particularly bad spine (the wonderful aftermath of a fractured vertebra that had to heal on its own...), yet most jobs about nature require to be in pretty good shape.I have seen young adults, usually friends, buy a farm and work together. It would be amazing for me to have this opportunity. But I know no one, I have no training in farm jobs and then again I am physically in not so great shape.This autumn will be my third attempt at completing the first year of Northern studies. I have been trying to complete it ever since 2018 and in 2020-2021 I did nothing of my life. I feel horrible. How am I supposed to get by in life as an adult if I cannot even complete a University year in a study field that I adore?I am such an inconvenience and a disappointment. I feel so sorry for my parents. My life seems doomed to failure.My apologies for the long rant. My life is doomed to failure.",Suicidal

I am not worthy. i just want to die. these fucking intrusive thoughts keep on plaguing my mind. it drives me crazy. and when i tell this to them i only end up on getting blamed on. instead, they push me hard down. they let me down. i want help. i really do. but why do i get invalidated instead of getting help? why do you push me so when i reach out of helplessness of myself? do i deserve getting blamed? maybe. but why... just why am i being compared to other people?i hate this. i hate myself. i hate my life. i just want to die. help. can someone help me? i want help but i guess i do not deserve it when all i do is laze around like what they say. do i not deserve help?i searched it up. and the close results were adhd, but then again, i would need diagnosis from a professional. and when i do ask for help by telling them about, i get reprimanded instead. ""its because you are on the phone always"" ""you are too addicted on such worthless things"" ""you do not live on reality"" i know. i fucking know, you do not have to remind me because i already say even worse things to myself than you will ever know.

"So far I have a referral pending to an outpatient program where I can hopefully get my diagnosis reevaluated. I was originally diagnosed with depression two years ago but that is when I was in a major depressive episode I was depressed for around two years. Now I am realizing that all my life I have been having severe mood swings and sometimes that is what causes me to attempt. I am getting serious about the outpatient program this time and I am making sure to keep a log of all my mood swings and symptoms for an accurate diagnosis. But now, what can I do in the meantime for self care?**here is the story: \[ TRIGGER WARNING \]**Last Thursday I started drinking alcohol around midnight, then woke up in a dissociative state (completely sober) and attempted to hang myself. I tried once and failed, then I cleaned my room for hours before trying again. I called a crisis line and they called me an ambulance.Still in the dissociative state I walked out of the hospital in the gown and no shoes, I got about half way home before someone called the cops on me. I was so detached that I could not feel the pain in my feet. But when I got back to the hospital I realized that my feet were swollen to the size of a melon and I had blood blisters so large I could hardly walk.I have dissociated before but this time it was severe. It looked like in the movies when you see out of a characters eyes (or POV footage) and even now thinking back on it, it does not feel like it was me who walked out of the hospital.I lied and said that I was still drunk when I walked out, and the psychiatrist on duty gave me the option to be admitted or to go home. I chose to go home, and now I am feeling lost, ashamed and embarrassed about what happened. I survived an attempt and was picked up by the cops after walking out of the hospital where do I go from here?",Suicidal

I always needed my parents to advice me to support me when I was depressed but they never did and once I told my mom that I really need a therapist she refused to let me go and see one . And for the last years I really needed to see a therapist until now but she never allowed me to do such things she thinks that doctors are thiefs and they are not able to make someone feel better and by time you will be a better person but It just get worse and worse I know you are going to say that I am mean to my parents but that is how I feel about them.

"I do not know if I have depression or not. What I do know is that feeling the absolute fucking worst about everything and everyone around me happens quite often and never truly goes away. This knowledge that my mind goes to this place so often always stays at the back of my mind and I am always acutely aware of it regardless of whatever else I am doing. I can see it in my own eyes every time I look in the mirror. Sometimes I wonder whether other people see it too, although I would guess not. Because no one checks up on me and the one person that claims to care about me is pretty shitty and inconsistent, although she is the best I have got. I lost all my friends over a year ago and I know they all still talk about me from time to time, which I am not sure if I appreciate or not. In this past year I have met a handful of people, but still feel lonely and could not identify anyone who I would actually call a close friend, nor do I delong to any kind of group of friends. In other words I am lonely. Sometimes I miss my old friends so bad and other times I am glad I do not speak to them for who they have become since then. I think this is around where my problems start but I do not know that for certain either. I am currently living in the worst stage of my life so far and I do not know if I will make it out. I am 19 and only a few years ago I had a clear view of what I wanted my life to turn out like and where it was going to go. It almost feels like all those things are happening and that I am being left behind to build my own new path brick by brick, and I am all out if bricks.

They only keep getting worse.As a little girl growing up, I thought I could be happy even if I was not pretty. I wanted to know that the TV shows and movies did not lie to me, and that I would have boyfriends, and go to parties, and get fucked at prom. I wanted to know I would get married one day, and have babies. I just wanted to be normal. But I learned very early, very quickly that I would never have those experiences. I got told my ears and eyes were too big. I was told ""dresses are for pretty girls, you can wear shorts."" l got told no one would ever want to date me, but at least I was skinny. I got told I should probably just kill herself because unattractive people do not end up happy. I was not even 10 yet, just that little girl. Then that little girl started to grow up. And everything they said was true. No one wanted to date me. No one wanted to talk to me. No one wanted to fuck me. I was ignored. Completely invisible. I did not get asked to dances. I did not get asked to prom. I had to go to war with a teacher who tried to fail me for no other reason accept the one he finally admitted to, ""I just do not like the way you look."" I am just not pretty. I know that. People made that very clear. Since I was not pretty, I had to become smart. I had no choice. The only problem with that was I was smart enough to realize how miserable I was. How much pain I was in with nowhere to put it. She was smart enough to go to college. Where everyone gets porked and finds their partner right? Wrong. That girl was told at the only party she was allowed into that she was too ugly to be raped. That girl was excluded from going to parties after that. People invited that girls' roommates to go out and do things RIGHT IN FRONT of her and excluded her. That girl was fired for being too ugly to work at the school. That girl was told she should just become a nun since she was never going to be able to find anyone to fuck her. That girl finally made her first attempt when she was 19. Which she failed, miserably. She tried again at 20. Again, another failure.That girl, now a woman, understands why men do not want her. she is understood her whole life and has been forced to just accept it. She understands that she will be alone for the rest of her life. She could shorten that life of course. She could make the pain stop. Would it be worth it? Just to make the memories stop? To not have to endure the future of more pain? What the hell...why not? New here and after reading some of your stories, I thought I would take a stab at telling a little bit of mine.

"Never imagined posting something publicly on the internet. My depression started in my early childhood. In my family I was an unnecessary child. My twin sister always got the love from both of my parents. I swear my parents never even said ""I love you"" to me all I ever heard was ""why cannot you learn from your sister"". Even in their last day before they all died in a car crash while driving my sister to her dance lesson I remember my mothers last words were ""why do you keep wasting our time you will never achieve anything in your life"" when I accidently hit my sister with a ball while playing with our dog. After that I got adopted and my foster parents did not really care about me they just did that because they got paid for it. I was lucky to get to keep my dog because she was the only thing I had left. In school I never really had any friends I only had 1 sided friendships where I thought I had a friend but the other person did not think of me as his friend. I also got bullied in school for being adopted and being ugly. After 2 years of being adopted my dog started shaking weirdly and it was because of water in lungs some form of cancer or something I do not even know now but my foster parents took my dog away so she would not have to suffer from her incurable disease. I swear the day my dog died was the last time I had smiled in my life and it was 16 years ago. I work at a furniture factory because I was to depressed to keep studying. I worked hard everyday and then spent the rest of the day doing nothing. My apartment is always a mess because I never had a true friend that is why I never really worried about cleaning up. I always tried finding a friend during school years but I either got ignored or I became ""friends"" with people who just made me walk with them like a dog because they never talked to me and ignored my questions if I did not ask it like 10 times. People in work seem to avoid me as well but I am used to it since school years. I am now stuck in an endless cycle between work and home.The only thing I have ever wished in my life was to be loved atleast once by someone who understands me who would make me smile once more and would not ignore me like everyone else who think so fucking high of themselves.

I just want school to start so I have something to do again. I have been off for at least three months now and I still have another one left. Its fuckin agony.

So I have been thinking about this for 'bout 2 years now and since approximately 6 years or so I cannot get sad anymore. Of course I tried to search for it in the internet already but the only causes I could find were things like trauma which I certainly do not have.

"My parents are not going to help me now. I have 3 pill bottles in front of me and if I take them all, I will not be here anymore. I am tired and if I live, my life will never mean anything to me. I just wanted to get better but no one believes me not even my psychiatrist nor my doctor or my teachers. Even my parents do not believe me. My life is ruined. I tried drugs to get past thoses ideas but it always comes back. I do not want anything to do with this world. Please, if you read this, do not ruin your life like me.

"30 years old. Father of two, one who does not see me, nor does he care about me. The other I care for full time. Two years old and perfect in every possible way. Partner for 3 going on 4 years. Maybe its a early life crisis, or just a wobble. But the thoughts of being dead to better those I care about often wanders into my mind. By often I mean multiple times a day. An extreme feeling of worthlessness and inadequacy, not doing enough, cannot be relied upon, not ambitious enough, I could go on for hours.I cannot shift the feeling of my partner looking for an out, I am now starting to believe my demise may be that out. Deep down I can feel all I truly want is to be wanted. Loved unconditionally and intimately. I want to be successful and strong in the eyes of those who matter. How do you do that, when all you know of yourself and what you are constantly reminded of is how inadequate your existing is. If my son was not here, Id definitely be dead by now.",Suicidal

"I relocated for my graduate scheme with my fiance, I have no friends here. My only 2 best friends live a while away and are busy. My university friends take no interest in me and have their own lives now. Work makes me anxious and lonely. I feel trapped in an endless loop of work- home- sleep repeat and my life feels pointless with no accomplishments. I have my fiance whom i adore, but he struggles too with depression so its hard to discuss together. I worry we will end up breaking up because of our mental health or because sometimes it just happens, but we have a new puppy together, a mortgage and are getting married in a few years. I do not want to be alone forever and I love him, but still the worry keeps me up at night that one day I could wake up and it will all be gone.I just think I am too weird or anxious to make friends, I feel like a loser and see mutuals posting on socials with their friends all the time, makes me wonder why I cannot have that.No point to the post- just a word vomit situation.

"I hit my mum today, for the first time in a long time. She did not deserve it, she never has ever deserved it. I hate myself for the way I have treated her and I wish I could go back and fix everything I have destroyed. People say things to me, or provoke me when I am already feeling low and it causes me to fly off the handle, and I emerge into someone that I despise. After these episodes I often think about ending my life, I do not think I have the guts to. Unless one day I badly hurt someone out of anger, because the guilt would consume me. Sometimes I cut myself after these episodes because it seems fair, but there is only so much that can do. My mum is a lovely caring woman, and everyone in her life treats her like shit including me and I am stuck in this cycle that I do not know how to change.

"I am not looking for sympathy or kind words. I just need to briefly open the vent that I so frequently forget is closed.Have you ever seen one of those charity coin spiral devices? You would put a coin in, and watch as it spirals down. It would go slowly at first, then pick up speed as the circumference becomes smaller and smaller, until an audible chink, and then silence. It reminds me of a black hole - a one way journey to the centre. Well I am somewhere on that spiral, maybe not at the bottom, but far from the top, and past the event horizon from where no matter returns. I guess in a sense we are all on that spiral, but I feel much further down than I should be at this point. As I sit at home on my computer, slowly deteriorating, having been to therapy twice and both times removed from the service for missing appointments, all that was interesting or exciting is blown away by the most gentle of winds, and all that remains is an empty she will of what once was. I am, by choice, disconnected from society, and I despise the human race and the brutal foundations it so delicately rests upon. I have problems with my stomach which mean I have such little energy that everything feels like a lot of effort, and I am in pain most days. The doctors cannot find anything wrong, and I have given up trying to find an answer or a cure. I loathe everything about myself, and by everything I really do mean e v e r y t h i n g! From the way I look, to the way I interact with people, to every nuance that defines who I am - an incomprehensible number of variables. As I do not like interacting with people anymore, and having largely withdrawn from society, I have also begun to neglect my hygiene and my health. Every day feels like groundhog day - waking up and maintaining myself for nothing, just to live another day in pain, a pointless expense of energy which I can no longer afford. Many days now I eat one meal per day, and struggle to find the energy or will to have a shower and take care of myself. I am beginning to be able to describe myself as Christian Bale from 'The Machinist', but less productive - at least Christian goes to work every day and forms some type of relationships. I eat when my stomach allows me to, I sleep when I pass out from tiredness, I wake when the birds become too loud to ignore, and I leave the house when absolutely necessary. I feel sorry for anyone that I befriend, as I know I will lose interest eventually, have an episode where I do not want to talk to anyone, and will inevitably just stop talking to them altogether, so I have stopped making new friends as it is not fair on them. I infrequently talk to the one or two I still have, and make excuses often for why ""I cannot talk today"". I struggle to make long term goals as I do not see myself being here long term. When I think into the future, I see a make-believe fantasy of what could never exist, nothing even remotely tangible given reality as it is precursor, and so I prolong my existence with video games and make-believe - a distraction, a way to delay the inevitable. But as soon as I exit the video game, the day dream, the false fantasy, and remove the veil of distraction, I am thrown back into and reminded of the world in which I am expected to be happy, in which I am expected to be grateful, a world that I am expected to enjoy, but do not. Every day I see the spiral steepening, and feel my speed towards the centre increasing. I am not sure when the slope of the spiral will become to steep to maintain my spin and drop me into the darkness of the unknown, but I am slipping. A Spiral Into The Inevitable",Depression

"Made homemade burritos for the first time in a long time. I had it all planned out and my kitchen gets super hot so I was sweating the whole time. Only to find at the end, my skillet is too shallow to strain the grease from the beef which that must have been some REALLY high fat meat. It did not dawn on me until about 5 minutes ago I could have just used a paper towel to strain off the grease.The nacho cheese sauce I decided to buy ended up overpowering my seasonings and completely overshadowed everything except the oil in the beef.So you could not taste the baby spinach, the rice, the tomatoes, the onion, nothing. Just nacho cheese sauce and oil. It was not bad, but it really made me feel incompetent. You know, I have been studying and studying on how to cook and season stuff properly and what seasons work well with others. Like for this, it was onion powder, chili powder, ground cumin and salt and pepper. could not taste any of it.For the refried beans, I also got some green chili sauce with lime, figuring it would really jazz up the flavors in the beef as you bit down. Topped with the rice, nacho cheese sauce, Colby cheese shredded, tomatoes and baby spinach on top to keep it away from the heat so it would not wilt and get that sort of really strong iron taste.I put a LOT of thought into this and it just ends up turning out meh. It was barely distinguishable from the likes of Taco Bell. I sweat my ass off in that kitchen and I put in all that work for that...it is depressing to me, i know that may be stupid but I genuinely tried. I have got a few lessons from it though so, I might try it again in the future. But for now it just kind of sits in my head and my fridge because it is just bleh Ick...",Depression

"So... I never anticipated or expected myself to find myself in a place like this. But since I do not have anybody else to talk to I might aswel vent here before I decide to off myself. &amp;#x200B;So today I lost my job. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming from miles away but on the other hand, I wish it did not happen or atleast I would wish to be able to turn back time to prevent some things from happening. But we do not have such a thing, so my life is fucked either way.So, the first week of 2020 I gave up a deadbeat, no life job for something promising, something with a future. Raised out of a family where such a thing is an impossibility, I could have atleast try. Everything was fine, I loved the job, It was physical, it was a challenge, I felt... Happy. 3 months later, I find myself in hospital. I broke my ankle at my job. Again, in hindsight, my fucking mistake. I twisted my ankle at a location where it happened once shortly before, but a donkey does not hit the same rock twice in a row right? Right. I spend 2 months in a cast, longer than what was expected and another month out of the cast before I could even attempt going to work. That should have raised an alarm bell. I wanted to go back to work, so I went earlier than what was recommended. And such, I went to work; They gave me adjusted work, essentially I had to sit in an office like space, controling valves, pumps and monitors. But no matter what I did, how patient my boss was the pain endured. And weeks of adjusted work became months, months turned into a year. The pain stayed the same to the cost of several different treatments. Every step I take on that foot is the same as getting stabbed. Even when I did not stand on it for 4 hours, 10 minutes of walking made the pain come back, 50x worse than it was before. And as my inactivity began to extend, so did my weight. And in the meantime, gossip &amp; bullying started to become a regular occurence. To the point where the bullies claimed I did not deserve a lunch break, or that I am doing nothing but sit on my ass an entire day... I had multiple talks about it, every time the promise of betterment was made. But every time, the bullying became worse. My mental state began to decline. Up to the point where I left half an hour earlier because I could not take the abuse no more and told my boss how I felt. And so, I was brought up for a final conversation. I could not even defend myself this time. ""it is time to let you go"", and was ordered to give everything back, from keys to badge... &amp;#x200B;This job was all I had. it was my jumpstart to a better life, a one time opportunity that was wasted because of a fucking accident that dominated my entire career. And it is all my fault. If I was not fat, my ankle could heal properly. If I did not show anger and frustration all the time, I could have kept my job.If I was not honest about how I felt, I could have kept my job. At home, I have nothing, nobody. Because of Corona, all my friendships watered down to the point where they did not reply back. Work was all I had. And now I do not have anything. Nobody to talk to, nobody to vent to. Alone, at the age of 26. Sad fuck. For years I have felt miserable but it was do-able, manageable even. But now I feel worse than that. A sorrow that drowns me out with no sign of ever getting better, not to mention the physical pain I have at the moment. I cannot take it no more... If I was not this ugly blob of meat I could have had somebody to support me right now. I am going to OD myself on both pain, antidepressants and alchohol later this week and pray it works. I am just going to make some arrangements until then. &amp;#x200B;I just wanted to share my story for the record. Even though it is vague and incomplete. Alright, so... I lost my job today and now I got nothing left.",Suicidal
"Hi all, I relate deeply to a lot of the posts I see on this page and I would like to offer some encouragement.There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the depression and loneliness like mind-numbing television, alcohol, and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.After years of therapy and growth, I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there &lt;3* Being afraid of being alone is totally normal.* The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seen/heard in the way you need to be seen/heard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the same/similar thing.* Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time, you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are, what they value, how they talk/act, etc. what is the difference between that and growing self-love &amp; self-respect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way.* To feel less alone, meditating for 5 minutes a day, journaling, and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me (that I learned through my spiritual journey/therapy) is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions - you will be surprised what comes out.* Start some hobbies, anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping, that is okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember, you have time.* Over time, you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want, recharge, and protect your energy from people.* We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says ""I am so ugly"" or ""I am so fat"" or ""I am so worthless"" - we immediately tell them they are not and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative self-talk, we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself, you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you are having a bad day and know that it will get better.These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you &lt;3TLDR; I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video, first I tell you my story, then I go into the pros/benefits of spending time alone, and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching ""kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat.""You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time. Friendly suggestions for anyone who feels alone &lt;3",Depression

"I do not know how to express my thoughts and feelings without feeling like an idiot, I have programmed myself to never feel externally as a means of survival, I have a solid exterior but inside I am torn to pieces.During my childhood, I constantly moved around, going to different schools, cities, I was never able to settle because my mother is a hardcore alcoholic, running from any responsibility.I used to come back from primary school and walk in on my mother passed out. I used to sit and entertain myself for hours in a silent, life less home.I used to worry about bills, electricity and food before I would even hit my teenage years. I had to walk my mother to the shop, whilst she leant her entire weight upon my shoulder, we would stagger there, day or night just so she could get her drink.When I went to school, I could not relate to the other kids, I could not laugh with them, I did not watch the same programs or like the same things, I did not have any siblings, a father, I had no guidance.During my teens, I used to jump into relationships with girls, but I was never stable enough to hold it down. I would go to school and fight the other kids, distract them in class. I was full of anger and resentment. I did not feel understood, my teachers called me names, made an example out of what not to be. I was the disruptive naughty kid. I was given detentions, put on report, constantly punished.I would come home to the same cycle, my mother passed out, or mentally checked out. Her pupils would change when she was drunk, I would know my mother was gone.Now I am 22 years old, still living with my mother, stuck in a shit hole city. I somehow managed to get a degree, determined to fight against the hand I would been dealt.I have been through waves of acceptance, anger, depression. It never truly goes away.My mother stopped drinking, supposedly found spirituality and detached from her ego. I thought she was healing, I was so proud of her and for once my home started to feel safe...I told her I think I aced a job interview today.. She started telling me all of the negatives.

She says I am holding onto the energy of the past, that it is time to move on.. She tells me I should leave the house if I hate her so much.. She tells me I am selfish, a narc, that I hold her past I have her head out of spite..I am sitting here feeling pain, I feel alone, there is nobody in this world who truly has my back but me, there is nobody to pull me out of the gutter when I am in need..

"Sorry about this being so long, I have a lot in mind that I feel is all relevant to each other.I have been trapped in my house for months since I have left my job. I left because I did not feel comfortable being there and every passing day felt like a drag. I was not happy with the thought of me working 66 manual labor hours with only a single day off to really do anything for what might be the rest of my life. In hindsight, I think most of the reason why I hated being there was because I was always drowsy. I would stay up really late (because I hated work) and would have to wake up early. The entire time spent here at the house since I have left work, I have done absolutely nothing to try to improve myself. I want to go back to work because I feel like a bum for being unemployed, but I just cannot right now. My biggest worries about going back to work are either that I am going to be fired immediately (because of my general low energy caused by my depression) or that I am going to be ridiculed endlessly by my future coworkers because of my awkwardness. I do not know how long Ill last working there with all the abuse I am undoubtedly going to get. I have thought about what exactly is it that makes me such an easy target of ridicule and I have come up with a few reasons. The number one reason is that I am boring. I have little to no interest in anything. This really sucks because I have plenty of ideas on what things I can get into to make me more interesting, yet I can never bring myself to do anything about it. I GENUINELY do not care about anything and it makes me sad knowing that so long I do not do anything to improve, Ill forever have this problem of being boring and being the constant butt of everyone is jokes everywhere. I honestly feel like I am undeserving of any human dignity with the way people talk to me. Like if I am not allowed to have any pride. I often question my intelligence for what I think are pretty good reasons. I graduated from High School with no intention of going to college because I was completely mentally burnt out by the end of it. To be fair, I think sleep deprivation had a lot to do with it (same reason as what I mentioned about work above). I literally told myself that I wish that I could turn off my brain and never have to think again. I do not know if its my sleep deprivation, stress, possible autism (undiagnosed), possible ADD (undiagnosed), or maybe even a learning disability, but I have a VERY difficult time learning anything. My brain literally HURTS when i think about anything and I just feel even worse emotionally for not understanding it. This depresses me for many reasons. One, being that I feel like a complete worthless idiot who will never amount to anything and who is a slave to manual labor work. Two, It makes learning any skill more difficult tenfold. Three, I just simply hate being stupid. I look up to the intellectual types. I value intelligence over any other human quality trait and it makes me sad that Ill never feel like I am good enough to have friends, to have a soulmate, to be a father one day, or to even play a respectable role in society. Ill forever be some dumb laborer in the eyes of the people around me. Despite all of these things mentioned that bother me, I just cannot bring myself to do anything about it. I cannot go back to work because of the mental state that I am in. I will not last. I cannot pick up new hobbies/interests because I honestly do not care about anything. The abuse will never end. I cannot learn any skills necessary to improve my financial future and overall social footing. My brain hurts trying. I feel completely stuck. It does not help that I do not know anyone personally who would honestly give a damn about me getting better besides my parents. I think its safe to say that my siblings, secondary family members, and friends (do not have any) would not care. I am on my own here. I cannot bring myself to commit suicide just yet, but I do not think Id be too bothered if I knew that tomorrow would be my last day alive. I do not have much to lose. I also feel like I am living a cycle that will keep repeating itself with no end in sight. Ill find a job that Ill hate but I muscle my way through it enough to be able to afford another break. Ill take said break but Ill feel like shit knowing that it was likely due to anxiety and Ill feel like a bum for being unemployed. But I cannot really learn anything useful to advance myself to a better future. So when the money that I saved up for the break is gone, its back to working my miserable job. The cycle repeats until the day that I die. Any advice or possible words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. If I do not get a single answer then that is fine, I am just happy to share this. I forgot to mention this earlier. I am 23, Male, and I have had depression and social anxiety since I was 13. I feel stuck.",Depression
"I am 30 years old, 13 yeas ago wen I was 17 years old I got sick, it got worse really quickly and 2 months after I entered the hospital I had to had operation to have an external heart support, 1 month later I went through a heart transplant. Since I recovered from the hospital I have had a severe depression. I became obsessed with death the more and more I read about transplants online, the mortality rate, life expectancy, etc, nobody even mentioned any of this to me before I got the transplant. In my country the person who has lived longer with a heart transplant it is been 21 years and is all can think about. I am not a good person and I have drank a lot in the last few years since it was the only thing that helped me forget about everything for some time, right now I just cannot do anything, I just cannot get out of the bed I cannot fake it anymore and smile like I everything is going to be okay. I do not want to go through a transplant again neither die in pain, I just want to die in peace, I wish I would have died in that bed before I took this heart from someone else, it could have been of better use. I just do not understand why in the 21 century we do not allow people to help them die how they want. If I were not a coward I would jump out of the window right now. I just cannot take it anymore",Depression

"From a young age, I was always a lot smarter than the average kid, I loved this till I was about 12. After that, it was always the pressure that I am supposed to be the best. and past the age of 12, it is all my parents care about. They could not care less if I am happy as long as I get good grades that is all that matters now. Most people do not understand one bit. I wish I was not so smart.

I am too young to already know that I am just going to spend the rest of my life doing something I hate. &amp;#x200B;Being smart also means that teachers do not care about my mental health. it is the extra work that kills me.

"And I am too scared to try anymore. I was abused by my biological mother, I was able to get back on my feet. I just went to court and got a restraining order, so she cannot approach me anymore. I was bullied at school, I was able to get back on my feet. I was raped, I was able to get back on my feet. I suffered a miscarriage, I was able to get back on my feet.

The nurses and doctors treat me like shit. Yesterday I was in the ER, I was in so much pain I cannot describe it. I was just silently crying and clenching my fists. Then the nurse comes and says ""You can go home, we cannot help you. Do you live at a homeless shelter? You look like you do ."" Then laughed and left. I was left so shocked and in despair that I just left and sat on the bench outside for hours. that is when I came to the realization that life has nothing to offer me anymore. I felt like all the remaining hope and life had been sucked out of me. I lost my will to live right there. I have lost all my hope. I have stopped eating and drinking, I do not shower anymore. I am in constant pain, and I am scared. I am scared of the pain. And you know what? I will not try anymore. I will not get back on my feet anymore. I do not want to get knocked back down and then have to crawl my way back up again. Every. Single. Time. I feel like life has something personally against me. When I look at other people my age, I feel a deep grudge, jealous. I know that it is unhealthy. I know that it is wrong. I just cannot help it. I look back at what I used to be, what I could have been. And I just feel deep despair. I am in a big black hole with no way out. I am going to kill myself as soon as possible.

"Told a very close friend of 4years that i had been depressed for a while now and spoke about my ongoing problems with self harm a few weeks ago. They then proceeded to call me stupid, that idk what I am doing and that I am just being an idiot overreacting on things. They also said that i will have worse problems in the future so i should not be depressed or self harm now. Ik they were trying to comfort me and tough love me but it still felt like they did not really care as they have never talked to me since and when i have tried to mention something they then said it was a lot for them to deal with and did not want to deal with it. Again i understand this, it is very difficult to say to someone that you self harm and expect them to know how to handle it but now i feel like a burden speaking my issues with them. Maybe i am selfish for expecting them to be there to talk to, i do not know, i just would have thought they would have at least checked up on me as i do with them and as how i am happy to help them and be there for a talk when they need one and because i have helped them. I know it sounds selfish but i expected more as everyone says to tell someone and talk about it Am i bad for expecting more support from a friend",Depression

"I am legit fucked in terms of any comp sci job prospects and grad school, got a full ride scholarship to come to this shitty liberal arts college and spend 3 fucking years just to get:\- No major, completed projects on my portfolio\- No research papers I have written\- No meaningful projects I have been involved in\- No job training in CS or job experience\- a piece of paper that will say computer science on itliterally just bullshit classes in the major that encourage a shitload of busy work and no meaningful learning experiences that would land a job. I have classmates from high school involved in CS at their universities who have built a bigger portfolio in one year than I have in 3. Despite that I have worked my ass of since freshman year working 18-20 hours a day on this bullshit degree, never been to parties or drank or met friends or what have you, just HW all day every day until 2-3 in the morning. this is definitely going to transfer towards my inability to getting into grad schools with their low ass acceptance rates and people like my classmates from HS applying and getting in easily with their fucking portfolios.I am planning on hanging myself if I have to go home after graduation and get berated daily for coming here and not getting a job or further education by my parents for the next X amount of years while trying to build my portfolio. The conversation today I had with them about how fucked I am was enough to write this shit. since freshman year I have never received help from my academic counselor to find attainable internship opportunities or other ways to build my portfolio outside of college, instead wasting my time every meeting since freshman year to talk about my feelings or how I was doing and to act as a fucking therapist. even now as I am trying to find grad schools I can actually get into she will not help compile a list or explore options or do the basic things that other academic counselors do to help a college student not end up living with their parents after graduating. I am struggling to even get above a 154 on quant and 157 on verbal for the gre entrance exam, so i know i cannot even rely on that to get in anywhere. almost all schools want a 160 or higher on quant. my parents do not give a rats ass either way about my education here and would not help anyways since they have not even finished grade school.

He did not get the message (or did not care ) and kept trying to get me to give in. I did, I was tired and feeling pretty unworthy/unlovable.

Why is it so hard to be happy?I feel sad when I find out someone took their lives because I know how it feels to want the agony to stop, but jealousy in the fact that they had the courage to do what I wanted to but could not.

"When my dad tested positive for Covid after he was vaccinated with Astrazeneca, my life took a turn. He had to be brought to the hopsital and stayed there for 2 weeks. While we were there, we found out he was going to be homeless, not one of his relatives were willing to help us, I begged that he stayed at (his moms house where he grew up, but now its owned by his sister who is in the states) in a year or 2 until I could stand on my own (broken family, did not finish college, still starting my small food shop and living as a caretaker for my boyfriend's uncles house. In addition to all that, I also tested positive FOR THE SECOND TIME with covid. My dad needs insulin and I will have to pay for a new place to stay, food everyday, and his medication, (100$ every two weeks)... in the next 3 months (until the government provides free insulin, it will be 50$ less) I really felt alone and felt like I was the only one who loved my dad. My family knows I grew up without him with me, without him supporting me as I struggled thru life, though they might think that he deserved what he is going thru, I do not. I am just his kid that he did not abandoned when I was 8. I am 25 now and still trying to get my life together. As much as I would like to take him with me, I am staying 10hrs away from him for my shop here in a bigger City, I cannot pay for it.

I used to be just contented with going slow in earning money, but this time, it is urgent. I do not know what else to do.

I feel empty all the time. I just want to stop thinking. I tried counselling. It got annoying after some time as I was hoping for more insight to help me, but most of the time she just asks what I want to do. it is always the same follow-up question. It gets repetitive and does not feel like I am getting much value from it all the time. Maybe I just had the wrong expectations? Has anyone found counselling helpful?I have had medications too. It stops me from feeling intense sadness which helped, but I did not feel happy, just a void numbness. I am just tired, to be honest. What helps me keep going is just taking this life as an experience and not too serious. it is easier said then done though as I still cannot help but consider how other people think.

Nothing I do gets me any mental strength and I run on a rolling 1-2 day cycle of feeling ok then heavy and useless again. As a backstory, I grew up with no friends, a situation I actually do not remember as I have recently realised I have SDAM (Inability to remember anything than the most recent few years). Which I always saw as a positive, because whatever it was, it was in the past, and I am beyond that. From 18-20 in university I always felt completely mentally strong and myself. Then at the same time found out about some infidelity in my father, the only person I had felt close to until that time (excluding my brother), and the only person Id ever call if anything went wrong. Fortunately those trust issues were compensated for by finding my first love at the time, but then when I moved to America, this was compensated for by drinking excessively for that entire year, pretty much joining a frat and drinking all my troubles away for the year without talking to my family at all. That year concluded in breaking up with my girlfriend at the time due to further lies and infidelity from her side. Then back in the UK to finish my studies and started work for a few years. After the initial getting over the trust from my ex, these 3-4 years were probably the strongest of my life. I felt confident, over all the trust issues (or so I thought), regained my relationship with family and friends. I had a great job, a great house, good circle of friends. Just a great all round time.Then I went to Japan, and again, the first 6 months of my life were some of the most exciting, new city, new culture, incredible new career, learning so much about myself. And found love for the 2nd time, which happened to be during covid quarantine, and as such went from 0-100 which was the most incredible and comfortable 3 months of my life. As someone who people say, connect with them in a way they have never experienced all the time, finding truly someone who I feel that relationship reciprocated is very rare for me, so was very excited. Then slowly over the next year and a half that turned into a steady comfortable relationship. Were very different people, but somehow it worked, I think she slowed me down in a much needed way. Although my good times previously were very mentally strong, it was very high-functioning, and I probably needed someone who just lived in the now bringing me back to a healthier version of ""strong mind""However again through a few of half-truths and lies about the past from her side over the next 3 months, sort of put a damper on it, and made me continually question the relationship. The thing is this time round, although not condoning it, I can actually see the logic as to why there was lies, and in my clearest mind can see that we still have a confident future together, as there was no malicious intent. Long story short, the year since then has been a constant rumination of mental battles on the SAME issues over and over again, mainly trust, and whenever I get stuck thinking about it, it takes me weeks or even months to get over it and regresses me back into my worst depressive states. And although I do not know the true because, the more I think about it, rather than from the actual issues from the relationship, I think the underlying issues with my previous trust being broken in my father and first love have put me in a position where although I want to, I cannot just let go of the past with the new relationship, and I struggle trust again, and this just screws up my whole mind.These ruminations were kept at bay while in Japan, because I was still surrounded with the loving relationship and doing meditation, yoga, and surfing to keep my mind as clear as possible. Although often getting stuck, I found myself getting out of it much quicker. The only way it really did however was to almost limit the longevity of the relationship in my mind, to limit how much the hurt caused me to become unfunctional as a human Now back in the UK for a month and I am STUCK beyond belief. I feel like the same thought loops get stuck in my head, and I find myself going over the same thing, and the same conversations with my brain trying to apply some logic as to why I should get over it. All this does is mentally weigh me down beyond belief, and just continually ruin my day-to-day life. And now I cannot bring myself to do any of the things which helped, yoga, meditation. Everything just gets me stuck in a way I cannot live. I do not know if its the being back at my parents home after so long, the relationship lack of trust, the lack of job, the culture shock or just all of them. I think with my idle mind is the devils plaything, and most of all it seems to be playing on my relationship view and ruining my mind.Now my every interaction just leads me into a state of mental instability. Today my parents came back after a day out and told me they bought me some new bedsheets as a gift, but the prospect of anything new / surprise / out of the ordinary just breaks me, and I had to walk away saying I did not want it, half angry, while trying to hold back tears. Just crumbing mentallyThen all I can do is get angry at myself for acting like a dick in the face of a kind gesture from people who love me.I just do not know what to do, nothing I do feels like it helps, and I do not want to do anything other than stay in bed all day, while I am torn about putting on a brave face to my parents so they do not see it in me. I want to get back to the healthy self I was at any point in my life, but do not know how to do it.If anyone can read this and maybe provide any help, something to do, something to focus on, anyone who is been through something similar, or even someone to talk to, I would be really appreciative.I am really sorry again for the long post. do not know how to continue in life",Depression
"I do not know exactly why I am the way that I am, at first I would say that I am not depressed I do not match all the symptoms. That was an excuse obviously, then it got worse. It is a mix of shitty days and just being in the same room as my parents. I try hard to tell myself its not my parents fault you are this way but yes they are a big reason and coming to that realization really is disappointing. I do not know whether to keep asking my parents for help or just wait until I am old enough, but I have been thinkingShould I tell my friends? I do not want to force anything on them, or trauma dump on them. I just want to be acknowledged, I just want someone else to tell me you are not okay and need help besides me. I will talk to the wall for an hour telling myself all the reasons why. I want someone to know besides me? They do not even need to help, I just want the knowledge that someone else knows. So do you think I should tell them? Sorry if the formatting is weird I am on mobile! You can ask for details as well. I have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts, should I tell my girlfriend and friends?",Depression
"Hi everyone, My situation was really cool, I was happy boy until being 16-17 years old when I discovered my biological sex is different than mental sex. Wearing woman clothes, makeup, doing things like woman makes me really happy and feel normal compared to being in unnatural male body.Unfortunately, noone around me, can understand this.I had many friends before, now I am talking maybe with one or two, mainly about stupid things.Everyone else thinks I am weird even my parents, who make fun I do not have girlfriend and look more like woman than man. Idk what to do, I would love to make full transition, but it is really expensive and risky. I do not have anyone to talk about that and besides moments being woman( wearing sexy clothes, makeup and getting attention), I am constantly sad and often crying. I do not even know any girls with I could talk about feminine things like makeup and fashion.What do you think I should do with my life? If anyone would like to talk with me, it would be cool ;) I do not know what to do anymore",Depression

"Just a quick update I am writing for myself, today seemed a lot harder, I felt like I was going in and out of consciousness, and just felt like I was in absolute autopilot for the day.Trying to stay strong and get my mind off stuff (habging out with friends, working out, going on walks, gardening) but its getting really hard. I am at a point where my heart just feels void, and I am scared that even if I was placed in the bestest of situations, I could not appreciate it or feel good about it.that is all I really got folks, if you ended up stopping by and reading, I hope you are having a good week, stay strong Update",Suicidal
"Chronic Depression. I am at this nihilistic point in a way, I am not necessarily apathetic though. I just do not feel like I am genuinely interested in living. I understand the good and bad, those clinical dead patients you hear about how that was the greatest moment ""clich"", I want that experience so much. My relationship is not great and I cannot even begin to describe what is exactly onmy plate. This is kind of how I feel in a point blank sense: it is a waste of time to talk to a professional because it is just advice, what they could tell me or what anyone could tell me is kind like.. yeah I know. I can feel or understand that advice but I STILL feel this way. Nobody on this website can take the amount of time to get emotionally connected, I am too much in my head irl to express everything to a counselor. I am a pacing, quiet, numb human. I am scared, lonely, and afraid. But eerily at ease and maybe that is the most alarming part. Being okay or comfortable in that depressive state. Strange",Suicidal

"Every so often on an askreddit thread I see a post about what men want more of and every time one of the top replies is compliments. I have never been able to relate, I do not say that to be arrogant, just to provide context and hopefully some people reading this may stop judging themselves and others based on appearances. Often through my life I have been told I should model, or complimented on my looks, which is rare as a man, but this has never translated into healthy relationships due to anxiety. I grew up with acne until I was in my early 20s and bullying left me with debilitating social anxiety. When I drank it went away but that is never a good strategy.At 25 I finally faced down a few of my demons and with the aid of liquid courage for the first time pulled a one night stand whilst travelling, when it came down to it I could not get hard. I had to jerk myself off to the point of almost finishing so when I did enter I lasted two strokes. After this I dated but felt too nervous about sex to follow up on promising dates, I remember one date with a girl that seemed a very good match, I cancelled on her hours before we were meant to meet twice because of anxiety.A couple years later I started going out and managed to pull a few more one night stands, each time the same routine, I would be hard and ready to go, then have anxiety at the point of penetration and lose my erection. Girls were put off by this and even those who had been chasing me down for second and third dates stopped messaging. This made me feel like an abject failure, I looked around at everyone around me, all able to do this fundamentally human thing, and felt isolated for not being able to follow through with the one thing that is the reason any of us are here in the first place.Since then I have gone through the cycle a few times: avoiding dating altogether -&gt; downloading the apps and sorting myself out with dates -&gt; taking a girl back to mine and going limp at the point of penetration -&gt; avoiding dating altogether -&gt; and on and on.At this point its not just the sexual inexperience but the inexperience with relationships that only further entrenches my feelings of being an outsider who will never fit in. I am now 30, my friends are marrying or having children, and I am unable to do anything more than smooth talk a girl into bed (and then fail to penetrate her).This is a deep source of shame for me, noone would guess this about me, I feel like a fraud. Some friends have told me they assume I am a fuckboy, it would be interesting to see their reactions if they found out how wrong they were but I am too deeply ashamed to share this w anyone.If I play this out to the future I am not sure what happens. When I was younger I had hope in figuring it all out, but that hope is quickly fading. I have tried cialis, I have entertained loading up on a high dose and visiting prostitutes until I am desensitised to sexual anxiety, but sometimes I feel fated to stay stuck where I am, and that makes for a very bleak outlook. If you read this far thanks, aware I am ranting now. Erectile dysfunction and alienation is ending me",Suicidal

IT WORKED I did not needed that second can after all with just the first one worked.so, I got what I wanted and slept like a baby so that is all for me being drunk for a few months because I will not even will feel the feeling to get drunk again because the feeling of my stomach feeling ""nasty"" will stop me from drinking.so, yeah that is my story update, Update...",Suicidal
"I just feel so useless in this society. I really do not know what I am going to do.I have been fired from every job I pick up because my depression gets the best of me and I end up being miserable no matter what I do. I start showing up late, lack enthusiasm, super slow and just overall have this I do not give a fuck attitude. Last time I tried to go to college it ended in a suicide attempt after taking on the financial and emotional stress. And that debt lasted way too long to handle. Not to mention I have a credit card that I also have not paid off and my Credit score has gone to shit. When I try to get professional help I end up not answering calls or not showing up to appointments, the process takes forever and I am always stuck waiting. When I start medication I end up trying to use them to end my life..The one thing I am supposed to be passionate about is art. I love doing art and have been since I was a child. I got an opportunity to make money off of my art (a family friend requested a portrait of her and her daughter) it took me 3 months to finish and I hated it. Although she loved it and paid me, It still put me through an existential crisis. What the hell am I going to do now if I cannot even handle doing something I love as a job. I am the TV definition of a bum. Live with my mom and freeload just playing video games and doing nothing with my time. I have two friends that I talk to every few months and a boyfriend who seems to love me a lot but thinks he can just help me get my life together one day. But he needs to realize I am really a disappointment and I am not sure how to fix this. I do not know what to do and I honestly stopped caring about my life a long time ago.

"it is been a rough year for everyone. I thought I was starting to bounce back a few weeks ago when I broke up with my boyfriend, because it felt like a weight was lifted off my chest. I had more energy, I started actually texting people back, I started tackling my enormous workload that had piled up, and I made plans with friends.But then 2 weeks ago I got nearly blackout drunk at a house party because the guy I started casually sleeping with brought a different girl to the party. It just made me feel so worthless and shit, so I drank way too much, picked a fight with a friend, then walked home and made a shitty weak suicide attempt. The number of pills I swallowed was nowhere near enough to actually kill me but it was definitely enough to keep me vomiting for the next 36 hours.I came back to work after taking a sick day, and was immediately overwhelmed with time-sensitive, critical tasks that came out of nowhere. Then Thursday night, my cat got sick and spent 2 nights at the emergency vet hospital. She might have cancer, but at least she is back home now and seeming better.I am at work right now, staring at the list of shit I have to do that is too long, too full of overdue stuff that I will never have time to do, and I just cannot fucking engage. I have been in this job for 2 years now and I want some career growth but I do not have the time or energy to apply to stuff. I missed out on applying to a really great opportunity because I was puking my guts out when the deadline passed.I just feel like I will never reach that surface. Nothing will ever get better, I will never grow and be more successful, I will never be able to maintain relationships, I will never be able to lead a good life.I just want to fucking die but I cannot seem to figure out a good suicide method.

CW: substance mentionAfter falling into the trap of going off my meds for a couple of months because I was feeling better ( and quite honestly so I could experiment with recreational drugs so let us just say that better feeling was very much flaky) I have an appointment tomorrow to get my psych meds in order again.Its with a new specialist my psychologist recommended (my psychologist does not prescribe) and I am really nervous because I know that readjusting to new substances is very hard on me.

"Hello fellow redditors, I myself have depression issues, but this post is not really just about me. I have been with a woman for a while who can be the most wonderful woman on the planet.

She walks away from me mid conversation, locks herself in the bedroom, tells me to go away, not touch her, calls me names, says cruel things about me, creates fabrications and refuses to get out of bed and try to do anything to help her depression. She frequently tells me to leave her when in this state and that I would be better off without her.Once the spell is over she is back to her happy Loving self with cuddles and kisses and words of affirmation.Now I understand that these things are related to depression, but my concern is the outright toxic behavior. She says that it is because her depression makes her push people away, but I am starting to question if this is actually depression or just an excuse to be toxic.I understand I could have posted this on relationship advice and I might also do that, but the reason I am posting it here is to get insight from people that have and are sympathetic to depression. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Depression or toxic?",Depression
"I am extremely stressed If i have to Talk. Even with good Friends. Which is why I started a one week Break Off any Kind of contact. (They are Informed about it and showed understanding) What I noticed already is that it is way less stressfull. The downside is that it still leaves me behind More depressed then when I am in contact with my Friends. This already leaves me in a Spot I do not really Like. Having contact with Friends: strong stress but Feeling slightly betterHaving no contact with them at all:only the regular daily amount of Stress but having nothing or Nobody that gives my emotions a little bump upwards. (besides alcohol, which I try to keep on a Level where I can live without it)This honestly feels Like such a ""choose the less Bad"" Situation and I absolutely hate it. I really Like to have contact with them but it stresses the fuck Out of me on a daily Basis. So much that I am having headaches pretty much every day.

"I have dropped all my classes this semester after not being able to muster enough fucks to do the work. Now I am trying to decide whether to try again and maybe fail, or get another job. I am completely disillusioned with all institutions. I have had 3 jobs (all construction) and wanted to die. By the 3rd one I was doing everything in my power to feel better. Eating totally healthy, making sleep a priority, working out. That job was definitely better than the other 2 but I think I still felt passively suicidal thinking that this is my life from now on. Just work, work, work with a few hours of respite each day and weekends that are spent dreading Monday which actually kind of makes them feel worse than the actual working week. I got laid off for covid but I was dreading getting fired anyways eventually because of how shit I am at listening and following directions (I may have adhd and I am waiting on evaluation results). I am working out more than ever for the past couple months. Eating healthier than ever. I quit all cannabis products. The issue of work still makes me want to fucking die. I do not know what to do. I do not know what work I could do that would not make me dread waking up. I do not know how to motivate myself for school. People just call me lazy. I fucking try but it is not good enough.

"Hi everyone, hope you guys are having a good Monday. I am a 24 year old female and tired about life. I deactivated my Facebook because I would get depressed seeing how happy everyone was. Classmates from high school are getting married, having kids, traveling, and having amazing accomplishments. It took me 6 years to get my bachelor's degree, while other people I know are getting their master's or getting accepted to medical school. I am currently trying to study for the MCAT but I cannot focus and end up crying all over my notes. It does not help that my parents always come to me whenever they need help with anything. I have an older brother but he does not do anything the the house, he treats the house like a hotel and my parents does not bat an eye. They do not discipline him at all and place all the pressure on me. My mom would also tell me that if anything happens to my parents that I need to take care of my brother, he is 26 years old. He does not have any mental disabilities. I am tired I want to move out but I do not have the money. What I hate most about my life is that I have no power whenever I try to tell my parents they need to try to solve problems by themselves or ask their other child they would get upset with me. They say I am the responsible one. I come from a traditional family, so as the oldest and the male should not he have more responsibility?

I am 16 and I broke up with my first proper girlfriend about 5 months ago in which the relationship lasted for 7 months.I do not think Id ever loved someone in the way in which I loved her.I constantly feel down and I am lacking motivation to do anything.I do not know how to describe what I fully feel but I just feel empty and I have a constant sinking feeling in my chest.I have noticed that I have started to develop anxiety and all I do is overthink about what could have been.I constantly feel stressed and this is the worst I have felt consistently in my entire life for such a long period of time.I am starting to question if anythings even worth like what is the point of achieving anything if we just die in the end anyway.I get thoughts of death which I never did before and I thought of self harming because I feel its the only way to cope but I have not yet.I am not suicidal and I would not do it but Ill just think about what would happen if I got hit by a car or died somehow and all my problems and sadness would go and I would not have to feel like this no more.Thank you for any help I do not know if I need help,Depression
"I am too much of a coward probably to go through with it, but I am honestly done. Everyday I wake up with intrusive thoughts racing through my head that make me anxious. I have no one to talk to, who will truly understand. I tried talking to my parents, and while my dad is understanding and listens, he has this tic (rubbing and licking his nose) that is extremely annoying and makes it almost unbearable to talk to him. He always takes it lightly and does not fucking change. When I try to sleep or even masturbate, this is what is on my fucking mind for some reason (stupid brain keeps replaying all the shitty sounds he makes). He also interrupts me a lot anyway, and while I know he loves me, I just cannot deal with this anymore. I have told my mom about this, and she keeps saying all the ""stay positive"" bullshit; do not go on social media, and all that. she is probably right about the latter, but it is gotten to a point where I cannot change. She makes fun of me for crying and feeling low all the time, I guess it would make sense since I am in my early 20s and I should move past being so damn sensitive. I have friends that say they are there for me, but I feel like they will choose their family over me anyway. I am starting to hate being an only child (even though growing up I never had an issue with it. I was a happy, live-in-the-moment kind of girl). I have told them about my feelings regarding this, but no matter how much reassurance I get, I cannot help but feel this based on what I have seen in reddit. I hate the fact I have turned into this monster who is so needy for other people's company. I used to have so many fun hobbies to keep me busy, but now I feel like I am lacking a meaningful connection with the people around me, so nothing compensates.I am not comfortable being alone, but I am not comfortable being around people anymore either. I used to be really confident and lively, but now..I do not know. I do not see my life getting better. I have even stopped enjoying hanging out with my friends in general, so I am in a lose-lose situation no matter what. I do not even know if I have a right to feel suicidal. I have a full-time software engineering job, I am in good physical health, and I have plans to go to grad school. Through college, I thought that if I work hard, I can enjoy later. I never went to parties, drank, smoked through my four years. But none of that matters. When my mom or dad bring up something even vaguely sad or ""deep"", my eyes already start to tear up. I hate myself for being like this. I was not like this before the quarantine, but oh well, guess the damage is permanent. I do not see myself recovering from this situation.I can already see my life ahead of me--perhaps getting married at 25 and popping out babies by the time I am 30. I feel so..useless. I think people will move past my death pretty quickly anyway. I am becoming some kind of hermit and passive-aggress freak anyway, so I do not want to hurt anymore people before I die. With that being said, what is the best way to kill myself? I was wondering if there was a painless way to do it. I might be doing that down the line, do not see a point in living a meaningless, lonely life anyway. Best way to die?",Suicidal

"Hey Reddit been a while since I have posted on here, need to get thoughts off my head. I do not know if I am depressed or just self-centered. To recap, I got into a good college and graduated HS.But past that, I feel like nothing has gone the way I have wanted. I have worked all summer at dead end job and have barely any money to show for it. My dad has not helped pay for anything in the past few years, my mom complains every time I ask for her help with something, and cannot even decide on my future.

"Weird vent idk I am confused .Ill probably sound dumb but everything made sense when I was homeless and addicted it was scary and painful but it made sense to me I knew what to do even if all I knew was just hiding my pain and hoping to die but now that everything is meant to be finally coming together in my life I do not think I am happy still . Its stupid I have been miserable for years but this feels different , I used to hate myself because I did not look right or fit in or get social settings and I flunked everything I tried and ended up just washed up high and being a waste of time . But now I know I should be happy ? But I am not . I got into to college , I have supportive friends and even a bf , I am moving into a new place soon , I have got a job . But now more than ever I feel like I am just right back at the edge like I cannot cope with any of it . I do not even hate myself anymore , I do not even dislike my self (mostly )but I have such fear and dread for every moment of every day ,every piece of expectation every every moment to come like my hearts palpitating at evening being awake . I am just not sure what to do or if I can even cope like I have thoughts all the times of just letting go again or disappearing or even ending myself because I just do not think I can do it ? Like even on meds from my doctor and I am still thinking like this . I am closed off like I cannot talk even if I wanted too and I desperately want to get out of this fear but I cannot and I am too scared of everyone around me even the people who love me to try and talk about it . Anyway I am rambling but I guess my point is , if this is when its meant to be good ? And its just painful and scary to me even tho its the best I have ever had . Will I ever find peace ? Or will I just have to just keep pretending and struggling through it ? Its just whatever anything happens my mind always goes to the idea of jumping and being free . Fixing my life has left me more scared to be alive than ever before and I do not know if I can do it ? I just want it all to stop and I know I should not but I have occasionally started skipping meds so I can re self medicate on my own time and I have been hiding that too . Idk its dumb like I said . Anyway Ill not keep this up long as its a badly written embarrassing mess , thanks for taking the time tho . Struggling still",Suicidal
"Usually I can deal with my depression but now it is just hitting harder.Earlier this year I had to deal with a really traumatizing situation due COVID and I held my feelings to myself so I could be strong (I have a post about in case anyone's wondering). But now I am feeling that the weight of those feelings are coming for me, making me feel worse everyday.I am slowly stopping talking to people, sleepy more and more, eating less, I am slowly stopping enjoying the things I enjoy, slowly drawing in this feeling. I was feeling my best a few weeks ago, but after being rejected by my dream job, I cannot snap out of it.I see my friends and boyfriend getting their first jobs, doing and achieving amazing things, making their own money. I will graduate from college next year and I feel like a failure for not having a job too. I am really proud of them, truly, but I am also dead jealous of them. This feeling is rotting in me, making me feel like I do not have any perspective, feel like my dreams are more distant than they were before and I am too tired to run after them. Everytime I see my friends at their jobs, I feel sad.

"Before I explain why I am about to end my life, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it, I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said, I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now, as for why I am going to commit suicide, there are two reasons: My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group, I never felt like I ""clicked"" with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried, I always felt different from other people, and not in a good way. If others were to describe me, they would probably say that I was ""weird"" or ""odd"" but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it, but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman, and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections, despite being in my mid-twenties, I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah, I know you are probably laughing at me right now, but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly, I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it, but really, it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members, but as fucked up as it sounds, not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others, I cannot function as an adult in society, and if I cannot function in society, then I might as well clock out. Additionally, I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities, both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself, most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell, has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot, stab, or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population, and while true, I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title ""Home-owner shoots robbers in home invasion"" or something like that, then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for self-defense, do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios self-defense is necessary, but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated, regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article, and surprise surprise, people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question, why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well, I do not distrust all of humanity, and I believe that this subreddit may have like-minded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short, I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion, then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you, I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do, you will regret it.

"I started therapy about two months ago. I have had two sessions since then.

But she always answered too late, and one time she did not answer at all. And, you know, whatever, sometimes people forget things or make mistakes.

"I think am going through depression.All i want to do is cry whilst all my day is filled with me meeting other people and pretending to be mentally okay.I would give everything for someone who loves me to hold me and say I am okay,and not crazy.I cannot tell any of my friends cuz i will sound annoying and they will say i am overreacting so i must suffer through this alone.Tomorrow i am meeting my nephew\second cousin who is 3.I do not have an option but to act as if i am perfectly fine,as i should be.I mean i have amazing grades,going in a prestigious school,i have the perfect family and friends.I think it all started 3 weeks ago.For about 5 days i was in a very bad state.Then a friend of mine,let us call him G,texted me and i helped him deal with relationship difficulties.Somehow that made me feel good about myself and i was happy for 2 weeks.Now they got back together and I am even happier,but the feeling of darkness returned.When i do not have anyone to care or worry for i feel useless.I am a very antisocial person so i do not have many friends,although at school everyone likes me.But for those friends i would give everything.You see G was the person i texted the most with.He stayed honest and very truthful to me which I am grateful for.He said how he felt which warmed my heart.The only think killing me from the inside is that i could not tell him the depths of my feelings.We talked about lots of things,i even shared childhood drama so he feels better.Yes i sometimes joked that i was going through something,expecting something more of a reaction.Silly me.Now that the little bird has flown out the nest I am back to crying.He is my closest person and i cannot tell him how i really feel,scared of his reaction and the thought that he might want to stop contacting me.Something i am experiencing once again.What the hell is wrong with me what is wrong with me?",Depression
"Okay, I do not normally post my problems on the internet... but I am desperate for help at this point. I will keep it really cut and dry (this is years and years of shit, condensed) But I really want to know if I am being too ridiculous or not, because my family seems to think so...&amp;#x200B;If a family friend who lived in your house, with your family, raped you (virgin with a chronic pain disorder), would you ""expect"" your family to defend you? &amp;#x200B;Mine gaslit me and refused to believe me until it was found out years later he gave me vaginal scarring and HPV warts inside of my vaginal canal. I had to show them the proof from the doctor. He works at our family business, and lives on our property still. I have since moved out of town. But I cannot be anywhere near my family or even talk on the phone with them without hearing his name or his voice or the like. &amp;#x200B;I let my father (who runs the business) know that I was working on my case with a detective, so find a replacement truck driver because once he gets interrogated he is getting kicked off the property and fired. That was almost 8 months ago. Two months ago, he was given a polygraph and completely and utterly failed it. he is telling everyone at work that I am a liar and he passed the polygraph with flying colors. My brother is STILL best friends with him and plays video games with him 4+ hours a night almost daily. He works with him. My father refuses to evict him or fire him until he finds a replacement, which has not been working out very well. &amp;#x200B;I have been gaslit my whole life by my family, and have really bad C-PTSD that adds to my chronic pain. My rapist knows/sees this stuff daily, and I guess he decided to join in because he knew my family would not believe me or defend me... but now I am getting REALLY fucked up because I never thought it would go this far. I never thought they would spend years defending my rapist, I never thought that even after PROVING what he did, my family al would allow him to slander me at our family property and business. The PTSD and despair is so intense lately that I cannot pull myself out of it. I get an hour of therapy per week but it is not enough. I have been really screwed up the last several years, but after seeing my family treat me this way... after seeing my own sibling side with my rapist... after he gets to just keep going on like nothing happened.... after he gets to lie and tell everyone he passed his polygraph... after he gets to keep being apart of the family... after my family tries to make me feel guilty for having needs or feelings... I cannot take it anymore. I just cannot. &amp;#x200B;Is it ridiculous of me to expect him to be given a 30-day notice of eviction from our property? Is it evil of me to ask that he be fired so I do not have to hear his name or voice over the phone anymore? Is it fucked of me to feel extremely betrayed that my brother sides with my rapist? (my brother already treated me like shit but I never expected him to do something quite this screwed up. he is been shown proof that I was raped, so it is not just him believing my rapist, he CHOOSES to ignore the proof)... Is it wrong to expect a ""family friend"" that is ""basically a 2nd son"" to my father, to get removed from our family? Is 7+ months long enough time to ""prepare"" to replace him? Am I asking too much? I feel I literally CANNOT move on or continue breathing if I have to have him involved in my life in any way, shape, or form. My only choice has been to stop speaking to my family members. But that does not stop me from suffocating in the toxicity from afar while my family just sits idly by letting him slander me to everyone around them. It does not help me move on. It does not fix anything. I am just secluding myself more and more. I have never asked for anything this selfish in my life, so I feel INSANELY guilty for even asking for it... but I would rather DIE than to keep enduring this, and having this make my chronic pain even worse. I just need him out. I need him gone. &amp;#x200B;I will not even go into even more fucked up details, but he also stalks women around town, and is still a sexual predator, and might possibly have an attraction to children as well given his odd behavior. Unfortunately I cannot go after him for my rape because I did not get a rape kit done (because I knew my family would refuse to drive me at the time, cannot drive myself with my condition. I was terrified and knew the gaslighting would trigger me to kill myself in a heartbeat with how fragile I was). But here I am, years later, still stuck in this crossroads. And now it is even worse. I just want the pain to fucking end. This is way too hard to endure alone as a handi-cap person.&amp;#x200B; Do my feelings seem justified, or am I being ridiculous? I have to ask because my entire life I have been convinced my feelings are always wrong, and I do not think ""normally"" as other people do. So I would like to ask the Reddit community---What do you think a ""normal"" reaction to this situation would be? If something like this was happening to you, what would you do?

The work it would take to function like a normal person, and the fact that I would have to manage my symptoms for the rest of my life, is just too monumental a task for me. And life overall seems miserable anyway, so why bother getting better? Nobody's ever been able to convince me that it is worth the time and effort or that I am worth anything at all. And so I have realized that that is the core problem. If someone could give me real reasons to get better maybe I would be willing to try again. And I am curious as to what those reasons would be, so I am thinking maybe I will try to call a hotline or something and see what they say if I even manage to get an operator on the line.

"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for years now but nothing comes close to what I experienced the last week. I went to McDonalds to eat food and was in line to order my food when suddenly this big guy cuts in front of me. I got angry and called him out for cutting the line.

I fell down on the floor and the man just kept hitting me over and over again until two customers and restrained him. The employees called an ambulance and the police to arrest the guy. All the while the man kept screaming and telling me how much of a piece of shit I was and that Latinos like me should go back to their own country. I was taken to the hospital: got a broken nose and a black eye. I was discharged that same day and returned home feeling like complete crap and hungry. Before falling asleep I kept blaming myself for calling out that guy and how I should have just minded my own damn business. I felt guilt, powerless and sad at the whole turn of events.

There was no catalyst for this change, everything simply got completely unmanageable. My current mental state is much worse than I could have ever imagined possible. Every minute of every day feels like physical pain. No brief moments of relief what so ever. Nothing can distract me. No desire to continue on. I always used to pride myself on being strong in the face on my depression, that suicide was never an option, not for me. In these past two weeks my suicidal ideation has been strong.

I wanted to work out for more then year now but i only get those motivation spikes - random day at random time i somehow do not mind excercising so i work out.I like to be alone, i do not enjoy being around people - i would rather be at home bored than outside having fun with my friends idk why is it this way :/. Maybe its because I am pretty shy and i view going out as something ""dangerous"" in my head, but i know it really is not dangerous but i have this feeling in me. I am also extremly shy around girls.I do not know if this is sign of depression but i get really nauseos from stress to the point when i have gag reflex but i do not actually puke.I actually need a lot of acceptance for others and i did not even realize it for a long time - i always talk in a way where i always need to be in ""good light"" (i do not look bad in eyes of others).Please tell me what do you think about this. Thanks and have a wonderful rest of the day. I i think i might have depression",Depression
"Its like my anxiety becomes too much and too overwhelming and too draining which leads to depression and just the lack of energy to be anxious anymore. Its a weird constant cycle where I am either having extreme anxiety or dealing with extreme depression. No matter what I do I can never win something always feels wrong and its exhausting. One of my major ways of coping is through drawing and animating but most of the time I do not even have enough motivation for that these days. I do not even know where I am going with this to be honest, but everything just seems hopeless. Drained",Depression

I constantly feel a need to express what I feel and talk to someone who could maybe understand what it is like to feel the weight of the universe on your shoulders. So if you need to rant about how you feel, or just want to make a new friendship, I am more than willing! I would love to make new friends, especially with people who probably understand me.

"this is my first reddit post ever. I am wondering is this suicidal ideation the normal one I have always had, just with some of the emotion and anxiety lifted because of the meds? or is it additional from the meds? before the meds I have thought a lot about it and known already that it would be more preferable to not live in this horrid world than it would be. I am 36 so have had time to think and learn about the state of things. I am not the type to do the typical life with kids house all that stuff. I am really philosophical and get caught up in existential crisis all the time, the fact alone that people eat animals sends me into a dark spiral of not wanting to exist anymore. and then I think about things like people force feeding street drugs to babies,..and obviously everything else that happens. and that people do not give a SHIT. about. anything. the earth, animals,other humans,anything. its sickening amd i just cannot handle it anymore.anyway, I do not think there is anything wrong with not wanting to live in a world like this, after all we were never given a choice. in fact I think it is normal *not* to want to, but that is just hushed in our society.so before starting the SSRI (generic lexapro) I already knew and felt this, but was SO overwhelmed with these thoughts and extreme extreme emotion and panic from it, along w the disarray of late diagnosed and unmanaged adult ADHD life, i felt like i was exploding more every day. i could not even think about existence because it is just too unfathomable and awful that this is how things are. i was at my wits end and its what eventually made me decide to take the SSRI (in addition to already taking a very low dose stim for adhd ), which I was resisting for a long time. always been anti-meds but LITERALLY could not STAND carrying on this way, so was desperate to try anything. i did not even care about my ""natural healing"" beliefs anymore. now, almost 1.5 month into the SSRI, it is like the emotion amd anxiety about this has lifted, but the knowledge is still there. I am very clear and calm about it now. I am working on paying down my debt, which was another source of my woes, and finally in a financial position to be able to do it. and regularly think about once I get all of my debt paid down and all of my shit squared off, I can then consider planning an exit, if my attempts at happiness or even just contentment do not work. I am close with my sisters and family but they just started having kids, have their lives, and do all of that now, I am so far removed from wanting or relating to any of that, and while I love them deeply and they and my cats are the main reason I *would not* voluntarily leave this earth... each of us can only suffer for so long right? am I supposed to exist in hatred and stress forever because I do not want them to be sad about me leaving? i know it would be terrible for them amd selfish of me but in the end, they have their lives and their families and their kids and they would be able to move on with each other. the more they start developing their own families, the more detached I become and drawn towards this plan. and I am not irrational, it is not like I would just leave all my hoarded crap for them to deal with. i would tie up all my loose ends first and make sure my cats had someone to care for them. plus honestly, its almost like its motivation for me to get my shit together, to fix my financial life. and it is almost like I am planning a vacation or a trip, I feel the same way, that same eagerness or like I have this thing in the distance that I can look forward to. I have always needed things like that, probably the adhd, to know there is something coming up. its just that this something happens to be the end of everything. which is relief!SO... is this alarming? i do not feel like it is, i cannot emphasize how surprisingly calm i feel about it. and like i have a secret too. but because I have never felt calm about it before, just want to reach out and see opinions. does anyone else feel this way and do you agree that its kindof more alarming to WANT to exist in this kind of world? at least if you are paying attention. and do not have kids to exist for.and i know I can talk to my or a therapist but I also do not want them freaking out and making a big deal out of it, that is why i would never tell family or the few friends i have. i think we are entitled to have these ideas. mostly just wondering if the SSRI is strengthening them or just lifting the emotion out of it. sorry so long. any thoughts appreciated suicidal ideation, recent SSRI, should I be alarmed?",Depression

"For over a decade I suffer from insane emotional pain among other things. I have tried everything. Electroshocks (only effect was loosing memory for 3 months), multiple hospitals, various combinations of different pills, therapy, solving issues from my past, selfgrowth, practicing positive thinking (what a joke) and many other things. Guess what! Nothing worked. So I was like okay I really need to try everything before I finally go away from this sick world. So noone can say I did not try. I moved to another country (I am in Europe), I got amazing job (IT field), friends... I have everything. I should be happy right? I even went on vacation for 10 days (small sailing boat in Greece) and returned on start of this month. Everyone is telling me that I will never forget such vacation and that it must have been amazing but... seriously I felt nothing. They say ""wow such an amazing view!"" and I just cannot see it. My illness took everything from me. I cannot feel joy, happiness... only everyday pain. If you wonder what is my diagnosis then officially its schizophrenia. It was explained to me that its only because they can prescribe most existing pills with this as official diagnosis. Other diagnosis are restricted - you cannot get any pill you want/need. So trust me that I tried everything and even brand new pills called Reagila which should have been breakthrough in treating these issues. But during those years every hospital told me something else. I was officially diagnosed with so many things that its really just one big joke. No one wants to admit that they have no idea what is going on and that they just cannot treat this. Maybe in next century right? Well I am not going to wait for that. I mean they allow euthanasia for people who are in pain and their condition is not treatable. So what is the difference bettween those people and me?! I consider myself as rational person but I really do not see what else could I try. I think this is it. I give up. Now I am just able to function with Xanax (basically sedative pill) which is helping a little bit (pain is still there just little less intensive) but that is also not a solution since its addictive and makes you walking zombie. That little lie... I mean hope which I told myself everyday - that everything will pass and I will be able to be happy... its just not real. I am damaged beyond repair. Like old people cannot fix their legs, blood pressure and other things - I cannot fix my brain. Its time to face reality. I am in peace with what was, is and will be.

"First time poster so excuse my grammar and format...I met my wife about 3 years ago, fast I know but I was so happy. I had been so lost and depressed and I found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. But I had my own issues and problems. I hurt her over and over (not physically and I never cheated) and she gave me chance after chance. We had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally I had the family I always wanted...A family of my own, a beautiful wife and daughter. But I continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...I was not present mentally...I was not supportive enough. We would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. But now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. She really tried, I did not try nearly hard enough. I did love her, I really did...but I am just a selfish bastard. We did not end in a horrible way at all, in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. But for all the times I have hurt her...for all the chances I had...I guess this karma coming full circle? I just feel so broken, hollow and cold. Like I am not the one who should get any form of pity...I felt so bad that I need to vent in some way...to feel...something. I cut my self bad enough to need a hospital visit...I guess that box cutter was not as dull as I thought. But the funny thing is I did not even feel it...I feel like I am regressing back into the person I used to be...the one who shuts out the world. Cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. I do not want to die, more like I cannot die. My daughter did not ask to be here, and I owe it to her to stay around for her. But I want it to end deep down...I keep thinking I should have died in that motorcycle accident years before we met. If I did not have my daughter, I probably would have put a bullet in my head already.For all the mistakes I made...I am so sorry...I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could start over again. I was so happy for the first time in years...and now its all gone. I am such a fool.

Lack of sleep, follows, of course, and while I am not medicated for these happenings I am well versed on how to.. handle them. At least I thought I was. It all started at work, right? Last Monday, a week from today. I was asked to speak with my supervisor right before she was to leave. She and her boss had written me up. Fine, fine. that is fine. I was fine with it until I realized they were lying about it. I had the proof. Proof somewhere, proof everywhere. Everyone Id told said it was ridiculous. I said it was fine.Until I looked at the proof. That spiraled into getting a binder to hold the proof. A notebook to write down times, a box of paper clips to hold proof together, a box of sticky notes to annotate my work lists and proof. I called off yesterday. I stayed up all night; the tv yelling at me, bugs crawling on me, my husbands itching disturbing me. It was rough, and it happened again last night, I did not get to sleep until 5ish am.

I do not really want to be the best or live up to my potential or whatever is that normal? Is it weird that I do not care about my future,Depression

"Had my dad drop me off at the mall today. Was feeling awful and impulsively walked up to the top of the parking thing and looked over the edge. I put my left foot onto the edge of the wall and told myself this was the hardest part, and if I could get through this I am home free.it is really scary, though. it is not easy at all. Not only did the height look just high enough to paralyze me but just not quite high to kill me, the thought of jumping is extremely daunting. I do not think ill ever get it done this way. I might go back up a few times before my dad comes to get me to familiarize myself with the thoughtObviously not asking for a more reliable way to kill myself, just thought id share an interesting experience I had. Also called the Suicide Hotline but hung up. Heard bad things about them and the last thing I need is a ""professional"" patronizing and demeaning me. Today I have the closest came to doing it",Suicidal
"I have had depression/anxiety symptoms since I was a teenager. I just kept telling myself that ""as soon as X happens, then maybe I will enjoy life again."" I am 35 now, been through therapy, on medication, and my feelings are still not changing. I do not really like anything anymore except for self harming behaviors. Every time I leave my house it is a chore. I have all my needs met, a job I do not hate, even a life partner. However, I still wish to go to sleep and never wake up. When will I feel like my life is worth living? When I am 40, 50, 70?! It seems a cruel joke that I have now roped in my SO into a life I never really wanted in the first place. I just cannot remember ever feeling like I belong here, and at this point I do not know that I will. Ok, but when does it get better?",Depression

She said she does not want to date and just wants to be friends. Its fucking shit, like what is wrong with me? Maybe I am just ugly or too weird, idk.

"I spent so long being sad. I have been depressed since I was 14. I am 25 now. I remember growing up thinking how successful I was going to be and none of it panned out. I am a high school dropout stuck in a job that makes me want to kill myself. No drive or motivation to improve my circumstances. Just driving to work everyday hoping Ill have a head-on collision with a semi, that way maybe it will take some of the grief away from sister thinking it was accidental, and also because I am too much of a coward to actually kill myself. I mean, obviously as a teen with a drug addict mom, the deck was stacked against me. Add-on being bullied all throughout school for being gay and having absolutely no self worth from it to this day. I should seek refuge in my own community right? I am not 160 pounds, do not have a six pack, and not fully white so they could not care less about my circumstances. I have tried the therapy and pills thing and I love getting to sacrifice any and all emotion just to not feel the negative ones. I do not even get sad anymore. I just feel bitter and angry. I genuinely see other people thriving and it makes me hope something terrible happens to them that ruins their life. Why should they get to be happy but I do not? Why is it fair? At least I always have alcohol. Its just anger",Depression

"Do you all ever feel like your head is going to explode with all the thoughts and idea crawling inside? I consider myself a pretty logical person, I love to find answer to things and do research, a reason why I love school. When it comes to my own purpose, the human purpose, why were here, how everything was created, etc I want to dig and dig and dig but it just becomes a cluster inside of my head. I feel like I am trying to dig in into my brain but I am being held back. I feel sad most of the days as I am trying so much to help myself and others, I feel helpless some days and others I try to cope with the idea that there is meaning in my existence I just might never know the true purpose of life. At the end I feel empty, miserable that I cannot figure out my questions. I have tried to find peace in the universe and creating my own spirituality with what makes sense and has logic. But I still want to know more. I have been trying to fight my depression for long and I still do but my head does not leave me alone. I feel like the only person that understands me (or tries) is my therapist, other than that I feel alone, also I was listening to Emma chamberlains podcast on spirituality and I felt like there is people out there like me. Why am I like this. I am so hard on myself, I am scared to not achieve what I believe is my purpose, I am scared to let myself down. Empty? Crowded? Idk",Depression
"I am a 15 year old male and I have really really strict parents. I have little to no privacy whatsoever. My parents are constantly questioning me about my personal life as if its an interrogation. They always go through my messages to see if they find anything. On top of all this they rarely let me hang out with my friends and they have strict limits on when or when I cannot use my phone. I am only able to use it for about an hour a day and they also banned many social media apps on my phone including snapchat, instagram etc. Reddit is not banned I guess because it counts as a news app. Anyways I recently moved to a new school and I have had a really hard time making friends. I have only made like one or two friends throughout the entire school year. I do not know if its my social skills or my lack of confidence or me not being able to use social media.

"I am 20F. Was born extremely premature, underdeveloped and have never recovered. I am the product of an abusive parent, both emotionally and physically. I had barely any friends growing up, and was severely bullied. I truly hate myself inside and outI have been abused and bullied by every teacher, boss and anyone who has held power over me. They enjoy it. I have no attention span and have never had any desire to do well in school, on top of that I have severe dyscalculia and many learning disabilities. I cannot even do simple math. I feel as though I am not human , everyone around me gets to be happy and gets everything they want and I get nothing. Ever. I have never gotten anything. My best friend is perfect. She is rich, attractive, smart, athletic and always has a boyfriend. She always talks about how lucky she is and she feels bad about me being so unlucky. She torments me about it. I cannot take it. Therapy and medication does not work. I recently moved across the country with my family, away from my hometown. So now I have no friends. None at all. And its impossible for me to make them. In college, I have only one friend. Everyone finds me weird. I hate talking to people. The only thing I enjoy is being in my room alone. I have severe health anxiety because I am convinced my body is not normal and does not work like an actual humans body, mixed with extremely bad luck. I have never had a serious relationship, every guy leaves even though I hide my issues extremely well. Never had a relationship end without ghosting. I have accepted I will end up alone because I am not normal or even human. I am home from college for the summer. I scream and yell at my family everyday, I am ruining their lives. They have come to hate me. I do not blame them. I cannot help it, I am so jealous of their normal sane lives. My dog is scared of me because I scream so much. I had only one talent and that was singing. I had a beautiful singing voice and I was a music major in college. It was all I had. I now can no longer sing because of the screaming. I imagine the damage is permanent and Ill never be able to sing again. I barely get out of bed. My room is a mess. I cannot get out of the house to get a job. I absolutely hate myself.

"This is a tough world. I know how many have it harder than me. I am a social worker with a Master's degree. I did everything right, but did a lot wrong too. I am human. I struggle with my faith. I never had a great relationship with my family. I am not here to cry ""fuck the world, it is all bad"". I mean I genuinely feel like I do not belong here. My mom died when I was 17, and one of my best friends died at 23. We planned a whole future together and it is gone now. I accept death. I accept inequitable suffering.I am having a hard time coping with life. I feel like I never coped with it well. I take great care of myself otherwise: I have good relationships, daily excercise, I am in great physical shape. I was never fired from a job. Nothing I have done has ever been enough. I am always filled with sadness and lately, bad anxiety. Irregardless of my achievements the future seems bleak because of climate change, student loans, high rent, and low paying jobs. Sometimes I am afraid of dying because I was indoctrinated into the Catholic faith of eternal damnnation and suffering. This has been a source of lifelong anxiety that has run my life. I do my best to think objectively and to be always kind, meaningful, and humble. it is a tough life. My parents do not believe in suicidal thoughts or mental health. I am sad and tired every day. I am not selfish, I do not take my health or life or anything of my privileges for granted. I do not. I always wished I could die in a field / nature center I care deeply for. I always wanted to leave a loving and kind mark on the world. I am not angry. But I am a lost soul.

"Hi everyone, first time poster!Maybe this is a post for some commiseration, but does anyone feel awesome, interesting, cool and not boring for long stretches and people always see you as that but then one day, you start overthinking things and the complete opposite feelings occur? it is especially worse when you clearly are in the wrong mindset and low self-worth just consumes you and no one, even close people, detect that? It feels like there is an asshole version of yourself inside your brain that constantly deflects all positive thoughts about you and intercepts it all. I am doing CBT and seeing a therapist every week, but I hate how these feelings rush over you and consume all of the progress you have made. I met this really cool girl 2 weeks ago and we have been having such a vibrant, interesting conversation and we have so much in common and looking forward to do things together. However, yesterday I smoke some weed with some friends (who I actually am trying to ween away from due to their different values, toxic men, etc.) and then all of a sudden I am having these feelings of not being good enough or cool enough for this dope girl I met. I am a man by the way and I find toxic masculinity to be something I really do not want to be a part of but I feel I am surrounded by men like that in my life. I am always looking at articles and posts about traits that are uncharismatic or make someone boring, and I objectively do not feel like any of those characteristics define me, but it still sucks that for every three giant leaps you take in confidence, it takes one day to have it crash down. My little brother yesterday told me I am extremely confident, and have been all of my life, and my coworkers always know I have a fun personality.

Her sense of humor is unmatched and remains the only person I have seen literally laugh through pain. Unfortunately, she does not feel the same way and she is beating herself up internally. she is under a lot of pressure both in terms of interpersonal relationships and academic expectations, in addition to all of the weight the world around us inherently puts on her. I am not sure how to help her and when I ask her, she does not know either. I am definitely guilty of having what I have seen described as the typical male urge to fix things and yeah, that is backfired. Ill ask her what can be done on my end but she does not know. Talking about it does not really help her. She ends up feeling stupid or as if she is an inconvenience. There are only so many distractions and they are only effective for so long.

The lymphoma already acommitted my lungs, and breath is turn difficult. The treatment is painful and hard, and I do not want to do it. So I have decided that I am going to face it as far as I can. When it becomes very debilitating, a good dose of nembutal awaits me. A quiet and painless death is a privilege that few people have, mainly, those who have cancer.My grandfather, who once had cancer, said this is a cowardly and selfish choice. But for me, clinging to life as flesh and bone, poisoning your body with chemotherapy, and after that spending the rest of your life taking care of the consequenses that such treatment brings, is a more cowardly and selfish choice than simply accepting your death.I have never wasted my time thinking about suicide, but now it feels like a good ending to me.

The perfectionistic standards I have for myself.Maybe if my mother had not had an eating disorder, I would not be counting calories and worrying about cellulite and bingo wings. Maybe then I would not hide behind long skirts and cardigans.Maybe if I had not been bullied, I would not spend hours preening and fretting over my hair and makeup. Maybe then I would not have forced myself through Accutane, nearly destroying my liver in the process. Maybe then I would not be drawn to the neutral, conventionally attractive clothing the world tells me I should wear. Maybe then I would not constantly worry about whether my shoes are shiny enough, or of I ironed my blouse enough.Maybe if I had been the better sibling, I would not work 60 hours a week, desperately trying to earn approval from my boss. Maybe I would not feel like I need to be the most accommodating, yet entertaining person whenever I visit home.Maybe if I was not born a woman, I would not feel the need to constantly perform. To be a perfect, daughter, a perfect girlfriend, hopefully to be a perfect wife and mother. As if that were not enough, to be pretty enough, to be thin enough, to be friendly and likeable and agreeable and well mannered enough to be seen as a woman of value. It hurts. I feel like a Madame Alexander doll, in a perfectly ironed dress, with perfectly coifed hair, and an empty smile, standing idly by my flower arrangement while I silently pray everyone likes the table settings and the food. I love my family, but I hate the voice in my head that nags and criticizes. I will not change. I crave the external validation too much. I love to be complimented on my carefully thought out veneer, knowing how much effort it required. It takes makeup and shapewear to be ingratiated into society, you know. In the meanwhile, I use drugs to numb it. Strong, heavy tinctures that cloud my brain and depress my body. Not so much that I relax my posture, but enough that my muscles can unclench. A trained eye could perhaps perceive, in photos, my glassy eyes, all but overshadowed by eye makeup and bleached teeth. Always dressed up, always smiling, always blank behind the eyes. I want to be a good mother one day, but this makes me question myself. I am my father, before his 10+ years of sobriety.I do not know how long I will live, or if I will die by my own hand. The perfect wife and mother would never off herself. Even dying under mysterious circumstances could bring suspicion. Not only that, but I have made a promise to care for my parents in their old age. Sometimes I wonder if having children would give me something to live for. Another strike against my qualification to be a good mother.I go through the motions, giving my all at work, in my private consulting, in my writing, hopeful that I will one day do something deserving of recognition and praise. I strive to be the best. One day, this drive may exhaust and overpower my body. Truly, only time will tell. I am suffocating trying to fit my idea of ""perfect""",Depression
Basically during a discussion I was repeatedly insulted during by people who disagreed with me but when I get angry and insulted people back I am banned from the sub and suspended by old account. It feels really shitty to essentially be ganged up on and kicked out of a community where I had been nothing but polite. The whole discussion was just over if Transgendered is actually grammatically correct to say. I guess the mods did not like that I said technically it was so is not an insult. Now I am banned after I was the one fending of all the insults. It makes me feel so alone. All I can think is nobody wants you anywhere. Nobody wants at all. All I can think about is taking all my meds and every pill I can find in my house at once. Feel suicidal over internet bullying like a child.,Depression
"I have dealt with some degree of depression all my life. I had a really shitty upbringing and ongoing depression passed along from my parents who are miserable people. I have tried multiple diff ssri s years ago during my therapy (Prozac, vybriid, Zoloft, etc) but did not like how they made me feel. Plus I got sexual dysfunction which in itself was depressing.I am at a stage of my life where I feel like I am better off, compared to before. But I still just get super sad sometimes, without a direct explanation. I was also diagnosed with ocd, because I become very obsessive when in relationships. I have avoided sexual and romantic relationships until I can learn to feel whole single. I have been in multiple abusive relationships before, and always used relationships to fill some sort of void within myself.Now, I am focusing on personal hobbies and career progression. I have a lot of things that bring me joy, things to live for. But those feelings of depression always come back up suddenly. I just feel really sad and empty sometimes. Since my past exp with disliking the meds I took, I have hoped to learn to overcome my depression on my own. But idk. Perhaps there is a chemical imbalance in my brain, like my dad told me. I wonder if Ill ever be able to be happy on my own. My therapist recommend I get treated medically. I have avoided taking meds for this. Thoughts?",Depression
"I have been depressed for a long time. The biggest difference between my depression in the past and how I feel currently is that I no longer have any hope that one day things will be different. I use to think that if I made change that my life would turn around and I would crawl out of depression and find happiness. Maybe that idea was always unrealistic, but I no longer have any belief that I will make it out the pit of depression. Instead, I feel condemned to be like this for the rest of my life and I cannot comprehend how I am supposed to do that. Like I said, I have simply given up hope. I have given up hope of ever being happy",Depression
"Reaching out was tough, I needed a year of ""I can handle it on my own"" &amp; ""it is not bad enough"" to admit that I cannot handle it. So I went to my doc, got a prescription for therapy, even adjusted (in accordance with my endocrinologist) my HRT dosage. I had counselling interviews with a two therapists (which could not take me as their patient though) and I got an ""assumed diagnose"" for an anxiety and depressive disorder, as well as an adjustment disorder. After asking many therapists and being denied as a patient, I give up now. I still got a couple of suitable therapists from one of the counselling interviews, but I got no strenght or motivation to check them out; partly because I do not think my situation will ever improve; even though I wish I had answers.I am just too tired of facing this existance of suffering and loneliness, where it does not seem to get better. Of course, people always tell you that it gets better etc etc, but I do not believe the phrases anymore. I got no hope left and wish this suffering would just end. I just hate myself, other people and this never ending loneliness. Heck, I am that much of a failure, that I do not even manage to SH, while wanting to (yes, everyone would say that is a good thing, but it just makes me feel foolish).Meanwhile I am forced to endure this existence (IF I HAVE TO STAY, I WANT TO LIVE AND NOT SENSELESSLY EXIST!!) I toture myself with checking out social media and making me feel even worse or remind me of my suffering, while not being able to stop with this bad habit. *exhales*Just release me from this suffering please ...

"hey. I have (F19) been suffering from depression since I was around 16. Over the years, I have been to a therapist (two sessions, she did not help and I cannot afford more lol), did a workshop with a psychologist and been to a psychiatrist (a few months ago, told me I do not need meds but we can revisit it in a few months). I just did a session with another psychologist, and I have just been crying from frustration. It feels like most of my time is spent getting these people to take me seriously. When I tell them about my problems, how I feel so tired of life and fatigued, they just tell me that I am young and I need to not take things seriously, because life is going to get tougher. I am just so sick of the lack of support. I spent most of these sessions telling them more about my symptoms, getting into progressively serious ones, and they just dismiss them. They tell me 'not to think about it', or 'be grateful for what I have'. do not get me wrong, I am grateful, and I already avoid thinking about 'it' to prevent crying, but Id still like to know how to get out of bed in the morning and not want to die. I am at the end of my rope, and done with therapists etc but my mom wants me to see one more. Does anyone else have advice on how to get these professionals to see that you have a serious debilitating problem that is affecting your day to day life, that I am not just going through 'being young', and how to stop them from giving you tough love and give genuine coping strategies? They do not believe me when I say I have actually tried everything (working out somewhat regularly, clean diet, cutting out toxic people and even fucking breathing exercises). Honestly, Id rather take antidepressants and finally take my life off of hold- do not have the time or money for therapy. But I am scared of going to another psychiatrist, trauma dumping and still being told that I should just struggle with this (when I am obv not coping and it is just getting worse) instead of 'taking the easy way out'. Need help getting therapists etc to take me seriously",Depression
"Hi everyone,I am on the long road of trying to live with depression for like maybe 10 years, I am 24 (F)So i will try to make it short, i am just looking for answers about my moods swings.For a few years now i have those really hard shift from being pretty happy to being very sad, suicidal. My psych told i did not have all the points to have bipolar disorder, yet i have doubtsWhen I am good i can feel almost euphoric, really self confident, like everything in my life is at its right, everything will be fine, i am more social and i feel so full of love and positivity. This can go on for like almost a week but never more. And then boom, suddenly i feel like nothing makes sense anymore, hate my self, anxiety rising, I am isolating myself, suicidal blablabla this can go for like more than a week. I rarely find myself in a normal state.I have been under zoloft for 2 months and like the good phases feels just a bit more euphoric which i found like not weird, and the bad phases are less deeper which is good, but i still feel i cannot live a normal life anxiety is waaay better thoThe reason I am looking for answers is that I am wondering if i have the right treatement? Is that the best i can be? Its really hard to live with these swings, cannot really have a normal life + zoloft makes sooo tiredThanks so much for reading and helping me out &lt;3 Mood disorder?

"So I started dating someone earlier this year. We hit it off almost immediately after I got out of a mentally abusive relationship (my ex continuously cheated on me and manipulated me anytime Id suspect it). I was not ready to be in a relationship at the time I met my current partner, but they changed my way of thinking by saying love does not have a timeline. Our situation started off rocky as hell, they still talked to their exes on daily bases, which is a boundary I created for myself. They had hearts next to their exs name, and flaked on me when they hung out with them. Had their clothes and belongings still in their home, and anytime Id react and try to leave they would offer to call their ex in front of me, or tell me I could go through their phone. I was not okay with doing so, and I still tried breaking up with them, but they always told me I was self-sabotaging by doing so. Being in a bunch of manipulative and abusive relationships I could not tell if what they were saying was true, or if I was just putting myself through the same cycle. Anyways, we continued dating and our depression does not make anything better. I know that even on my worst days I make effort to talk to them, but it gets tiring knowing that they still make effort to communicate and hangout with their ex while it feels like they are doing the bare minimum for me. We go from hanging out often to barely seeing each-other/talking in week intervals, although I understand the concept of space. It gets confusing knowing the state of our relationship. We work on communication more than anything, but no matter how many times they have said its okay to communicate anything that bothers me to them, it seems like it always goes up in flames and that my perspective is always false. With their depression active the past month, I just asked them for a little initiative when talking to me, its hard feeling like I am the only one who reaches out and knowing their daily routine of waking up, checking their phone, texting people and going on Twitter I feel like I am asking for the bare minimum when I tell them just a simple good morning text would make me feel a little more cared about, but instead they got upset with me saying I do not understand that their depression makes it hard to even get up in the morning . what is frustrating is that I know exactly how they feel because I experience it also. I just want to feel the same amount of effort I am putting out, but maybe I am lacking compassion in this instance? I am sorry for my rant, I am just feeling quite low in this situation. Thank you for reading. the clinically depressed dating each other",Depression

And it fucks up my mood for the whole day. she is a good person but her words and the way she handles things really bothers me. she is very loving but she does not handle things good. My dad was leaving out of town because one of his friends died. Instead of giving my dad a warm goodbye she gave a cold one which lead them having a little argument. Idk why she does that. Then she ends up feeling sad which makes me sad and it is annoying. Just bad vibes. I just want to make it clear that she is not a horrible person. She Just complicated and sensitive.

So I need help guidance on how to help my brother. So my brother who is 24 broke up with his girlfriend about 4 months ago ever since he has been down hill just about 3 weeks ago he opened up to me. He is a alcoholic drinks every day he is so depressed about his break up and I think that the root of this. He has cut him self multiple times. He drinks hard liquor now just to hide the pain. He tells me he wishes this would just go away. He said ever since he open about his depression and alcoholism to the family he feels more depressed. Today he has a appointment with a psychiatrist also I am trying to get him to go to AA meetings. But idk if I am to late because he is drinking at his job and he is drinking when he gets home. I am afraid he might kill someone and himself. Yesterday he told me that whatever happens happens and that he is not afraid to die. The big problem I see here is that when he is alone at his job a feel he looses the mental battle and seeks alcohol. I am afraid I am to late to help my little brother. Also I feel like my parents just tell him to man up and now I am responsible for him and if something happens to him its on me. I do not want to live with that burden. Idk what to do I could not sleep last night all I thought about was him. I have talked to him multiple times and every time he just breaks down and cries he is willing to seek help but I kind of since he is also suicidal. Idk what to do or what to say my anxiety is threw the roof. Any advice would be appreciated thank you. Need help!!!!,Depression

"I have entered what I would probably characterize as the darkest period of my life so far. I am in a job I despise, and I recently started therapy, which has overall been a net positive, but it is also forced me to take a long and hard look at many personal traits of my own that need a A LOT of work. I am realizing I do not have a strong sense of personal identity and that I have a much lengthier and more problematic track record of behaving in toxic and manipulative ways. All-in-all: my opinion of myself is quickly rocketing into the dirt and I am in the midst of the most intense identity crisis I have ever experienced.All of this and a slew of other unpleasant factors have left me feeling like I am heading right for a potentially explosive breakdown. Like, I am about to get married and I love my fiance very much, but making a lifelong commitment like that to another human being when I myself feel like I have no clue who I am, what my values and passions are, or where I am heading in life scares the shit out of me. I have also recently began indulging some self-harm impulses (which are relatively minor and not life-threatening or scarring) for the first time in over a decade which feels like such an enormous step backwards for me. I feel like a rubber band stretched to the brink of snapping and some unknown combination of time and/or additional tension will inevitably make me snap. I do not know what to do about it, because the more I think about the state I am in, the more I feel like I am spiraling out of control. But I also feel like I cannot NOT think about it because ignoring and repressing my problems and my mistakes is how I ended up here in the first place. The worst part is that, even though I can feel the meltdown coming, I feel powerless to stop it. Which is kind of how I would sum up my current crisis: a complete loss of control over my life and the direction it is going in.Has anyone experienced anything like this before? If so, any tips on how to deal with yourself or at least keep yourself from hurting others while your life is unravelling? Even if not, I appreciate having the space to vent. (For the record: I am not presently concerned I am going to kill myself, and I am not worried I am at risk of physically hurting others. But I am worried I am at risk of burning all of my bridges and tanking all my personal and professional relationships into the ground and causing a lot of emotional damage to myself and others on the way.) What do you do when you feel yourself beginning to unravel? Can I at least mitigate the damage my impending breakdown could because others?",Depression

"I was on depression medication bc I was having chest pains at random times. they did the full screening of my body to make sure it was not physically and everything was good. I started them and they were like okay? like it just kind of made me motivated than anything. sexual side effects got to me so now I am only on anxiety, which stops the chest pain but i still get anxious so like, I guess it stopped the terrible chest pain but like I am still anxious, which I guess is normal. I feel like its impossible to be in a relationship when I am like this. I broke up with my girlfriend for a few months like a year ago and I truly felt so good for awhile. maybe even she is weighing on me? Anyways any tips anyone has on how they beat their depression battles? my depression is not like self harm but sometimes think what would happen if I just wrecked my car (even though I never intentionally would), just some bad thoughts that I would not act on, no motivation, distance myself from everyone. for years I hated how skinny I was and when me and my gf broke up I put on some muscle and now I am getting a stomach I absolutely hate seeing, which then I do not put any consistent time into working out which does not help my mind either. I went on a few vacations and that was good to be out of this shitty area. mixed 21 year old in a republican/ racist ass area. like literally seen n word killer and drive by a truck with a black stay back sticker every single day. I am also absolutely terrible about talking about anything. I need out of this but idk how. I feel like last time I got like this I just broke up with my girlfriend and do not want to do that again. i work full time but literally do next to nothing all week which probably is not good for me in any way either. like where does this motivation come from? I want to actually be able to get out and stay out of this headspace. I am like genuinely ever happy just playing PlayStation with my friends/ talking to my friends on there. its the only time I am ever myself (and with gf). its like a big ass disconnect from everything and lifes actually hood.

"I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine, whatever, I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits, and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever, with no end in sight besides failure. I just want to break the cycle but it does a real good job of keeping you sucked in. Depression + Anxiety has destroyed my ability to function as a student",Depression

"I will try to keep it short, I have got selected to a top Bschool in my country and after 1 month of attending classes I realized that again I made the same mistake in choosing my career which lead me to depression, I choose financial security over what I like doing. Earlier I sacrificed my career for that my family will benefit if i get a well paying job and me being good at academics I was able to crack the most difficult exams too but then later I realized I am not happy and I do see my self doing this work all my life or even a major chunk of time like 10 years. Now again I am stuck in a really lucrative and secure option but since my mental health is not good because I am not able to see myself happy even after I end up with a good job. I am just becoming a loser again and if i decide to dropout and do what I like doing .i.e. startup, but I fear that if it fails then I will not be able to bounce back at age of 26(yes I am 26 now and I am from South Asia) and I will end up as a failure and loser which I never was, I miss my 15 year old self who was passionate and driven and absolutely acing in everything but now I am a big failure story. So I want to see how guys see this problem from your perspective because I cannot think through and I do not want to trouble my family anymore. So what should I choose, security or what i love doing?

"I do not have no freedom to do the things I enjoy. Unfortunately, I have to hide myself of being gay from my family. My mom is severely homophobic and she has some suspicion I am gay because she snooped my phone and saw some flirting between me and a guy (aka my LDR BF). I asked my mom if I can go to my best friends birthday party yesterday, and she said no. But that is not what bothered me, she said ""Your best friend better not introduce you to any guys"". She said some other homophobic things to but I forgot what she said. I lost a lot of faith in my LDR working out.Since we come from an asian family, there is a lot of asian guilt. My dad is leaving us next year to go back to his country (as he is separating from my mom), and the idea of me moving out is gone because part of me feels extremely guilty for leaving my mom alone when she does not make enough money. But on the other hand, I know she is extremely homophobic and she even discourages me from making friends too much. I have been really socially deprived as an introvert and I feel like I am missing out because its not like I have a lot of friends. Tbh, I feel suicidal because everything is only getting worse. I feel I might have to break up with my BF because I do not want to drag him anymore. He deserves someone better. he is been really understanding but at this point everything is breaking me apart and I am not sure if I can commit myself to a relationship.My mom always says stuff like , ""Gay people are always getting into trouble and gay people are aids."" My mom is also invasive of my privacy, like on my phone, and my online whereabouts. she is so against me flirting when people younger then me are already in relationships. I have been suicidal before, but at this point, I am becoming suicidal again. Ofcourse, there is other people's situation worse then mines and my heart aches for them.

I can usually tell when my depression is slowly starting to become a more prominent feature in my day to day life by how much I am looking forward to going to bed. When one of my first thoughts in the morning is one of returning to sleep not in that moment but at the end of the day. That is a fairly strong indicator for me. My sense of self worth plummets even lower than usual and my mind starts to slowly but surely focus on dark thoughts. Something that seems unthinkable during more normative times suddenly starts to feel like an excellent idea and the most logical solution. Hopefully this time things will be different.

"Some background info first:Our relationship has been going on for about 3 months now. Although that is not a long time, we have already managed to build a really strong bond and our relationship has progressed pretty fast.I just recently graduated and am now looking forward to studying at an university.My boyfriend has everything going for him as well. He just recently got his own amazing apartment, he has a well paid and stable job and a supportive family. I live within a short distance away from him with my mom.Everything was going really well at first and within the first month of us dating, he told me about his struggle with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. In 2020, a lot went wrong and he was really close to ending his life. He names his mother as the only reason he did not do it - he did not want her to go through the pain of losing her only child. He already went through therapy twice that year (which did not help). Taking any kind of pills is not an option for him. When we met, he was having a ""good phase"", but during the past few weeks things have been getting worse and worse. Some days are really good, others really really bad. I have struggled with mental health issues myself, so I can relate to the feelings he is having to some degree. But his depression is unlike anything I have ever witnessed.When he is having a bad day and I am with him, we barely talk and there is a lot of tension. He tries not to let it out on me, which works most of the time.But it still hurts me to see him in so much pain.To listen to the person you love talking about suicide, is a feeling unlike any other. I feel like I am not able to do anything about it.We often talk about the things that are bothering him. he is just convinced that there is no meaning to life and everything is already going downhill for humanity because of climate change and never-ending waves of corona.(These are just a few of his reasons)I know I cannot ""fix"" his depression or really do anything about the issues that are bothering him, but I still feel so useless and hopeless.I truly love him and want to be a supportive girlfriend. it is not an option for me to leave him, even tho this whole thing is really testing my beliefs and draining my own mental health. I am incredibly scared of him making a wrong decision and I honestly think he is very close to that.Has anyone had similar experiences with loved ones that are struggling with depression?Is there any way I can help more effectively (besides just being supportive, listening, being there for him,...)If anyone has read this far, thank you and I hope that there are people that are able to give me some good advice(English is not my first language- so please excuse any mistakes or weird phrasing) I (W/18) am scared of my boyfriend (M/20) committing su*cide",Depression

"Honestly I thought I had my shit together. I was diagnosed in 2018, so I decided to take a break from uni. Got a whole lot better, like I stopped having panic attacks, no longer hated to see my reflection in the mirror, no longer sleep excessively. It was a good year of rest, and then I decided it was time for to continue uni, and I needed to do an internship because it was one of the graduation requirements. Never would I thought that this internship was going to be the reason I relapsed. Basically it was the only position that was available for me, the other places rejected me. I am only required to do a 3 months internship but they requested it to be 5 months and I accepted because beggars cannot be choosers. Little did I know that this place was a shithole. Communication was 100% online yet they will not let join any group chat regarding any project whatsoever because I am an ""outsider"" and ""temporary"", yet they also throw their responsibilities to me without warning, I am not given any mentoring whatsoever. I am a graphic design student, and I feel like i have lost all sense of good design because my department head keeps requesting outdated design and honestly they do not make sense. I have been pestered by a coworker about the project that she dumped on me without warning. I have been humiliated in weekly meetings. I am losing sleep and losing my patience, and most of all I lost my self esteem.I only have like 5 days left till my internship is over but every waking hour is like hell. I cry in the shower, before I sleep, and before I start work. Lately I can barely get up from my bed, make so little progress for work, and now I panic whenever I hear my phone notifications go off because I am afraid of what my coworkers would say bout my work. Plus I also only get paid 1/10 of our minimum wage, and i use that money to pay for my internet plan so I can work online, so its basically unpaid internship. If any of you are beaten down so bad by your surroundings to the point of depression, I understand. I have supportive friends and I can barely go through this shit. If I faced this alone, I am pretty sure I would have disappeared to a neighbouring town and change my identity, and made sure no one will ever hear from me again. I swear I am this close to giving up Depression relapse",Depression

"Hey, everyone. First off, I will start by saying that this is my first post here, so do please let me know if I have broken any rules with it.Secondly, to give some context (and to also let off some steam), I am pretty sure I have been depressed one way or another for a very long time now. I have never been diagnosed by-the-book, but every therapist I have seen so far has pretty much let me know that it is there. From what I have read and discussed with them, my best guess is that I have something related to dysthymia, although I would say I am generally pretty functional - it is like having an autopilot which allows me to go through the daily routine while being miserable and hopeless (there is no official diagnosis because the therapists I have seen do not like applying labels and have not considered it severe enough to recommend a psychiatric evaluation).I occasionally get an episode which is worse than the norm. I mostly always feel a sense of generalised hopelessness and sadness, but the episodes feel like I am thrown down a bottomless pit of despair. I am currently going through one of these episodes as a result of recently having done a sum-up of my life during the past few years.My problem right now, and the reason why I post this here, is that I feel that my support group, my few close friends to whom I have only relatively recently started opening up about this, have started trying to persuade me that my depression's incorrect, somehow. I have been thinking pretty much all day that maybe I am just too sensitive at this particular point in time and maybe I am reading too much into it, but I keep feeling minimised and invalidated when talking to them (stuff like ""you have an incorrect view of yourself,"" ""you are being overly-dramatic,"" ""I am sure things are not as bad as you see them,"" ""maybe you have some form of dissociative disorder"" - this last one came straight out of left field, since all of the therapists I have seen so far have, at one point or another, remarked my fervent insistence on keeping facts and reality as straight as I possibly could). All of these just... hurt, especially knowing my history of deep-diving into my thoughts and realising that most points which because me my unrest are conclusions drawn according to objectively negative and damaging experiences from throughout my life.do not get me wrong, I know depression does not really allow for objective perspectives, even less so during an intense episode, but everything they say just makes me feel like they are not even trying to take it seriously, even for a second.they are currently insisting that I join them for a group call to discuss ""magical realism"" (an attempt at a joke, I assume), but I really do not feel like that kind of invalidation and minimisation's what I need right now. My question, thus, is how do I deal with this? Am I taking things too personally, is this entire thing just another element of my episode? If not, how could I politely explain this to them without them having a knee-jerk reaction? I am honestly reticent to broach the subject because I expect they will lean even harder onto that ""incorrect perception"" of mine and I really do not want to upset them more than I clearly am doing with my episode. Hard enough to open up about it in the first place... Thank you for taking the time to read through all of that, and thank you in advance for any advice you could offer.

"Hello everyone,I rarely post on Reddit but.....I have nowhere else to go. I have talked to my selected friends but all your inputs are important. I would like to warn everyone this may have religious talks and depression....yeah....like that.....I have a bestfriend of 20 years. This year she will be getting married to the love of her life. I am genuinely happy for her. I really am. Here is the story: My bestfriend got engaged last January 1. She is currently living in United Kingdom, have a wonderful job and loving Fiance. After the engagement, she told us and her closest friends and family that they will wed next year July of 2022. So I was really ecstatic of hearing such wonderful news, at last she will settle down and create a family of her own. She told me that she wants me and our other bestfriend to be there at her wedding, we are three. we have been bestfriends since High School. I got fired up to save a lot of money for plane ticket and pocket money to be with her on her special day. Since I live in Asia, and the cost when you go to UK will cost a lot since our salary here is like x10 lower than what people earn in the western countries.&amp;#x200B;Til one time, she suddenly asked me if I could ask my Uncle who is a priest if Cohabitation is a sin. I asked her like why? She told me she and her Fiance wants to live together, because living in separate houses traveling back and forth every weekend is very tiring for the both of them. I told her if they want to live together without tying the knot yet is not a big deal. If that will help save them gas and transportation allowance, then go. But she told me she is looking for answers and admitted they are in abstinence from sex for how many months now. She felt guilt doing pre-marital sex, and she always seeks answers from God. Asking for signs and that. There is nothing wrong with that, I am a religious person myself but I do what I do. I know my limits. We have this saying in our country: ""God have mercy on us, man has their doing."" When I talked to my Uncle who is a priest and asked him about Cohabitation, he just straightly answered that: Cohabitation is a sin. And I told my bestfriend about it and she contemplated about it. And I know she is been asking a lot of people and even religious leaders in her country. And most of them told her there is nothing wrong if they want to live together. She is still reluctant. And fighting her Anxieties over the matter. To the point that we raised our voice at each other during a video call, because she told me that my life become shitty because of karma, because I lived with my boyfriend for 1.5 years. It was a really big stab in my heart, and I cried but I dismiss what I felt and I still prioritize her because I know she is more vulnerable than I am. Fast forward.......I do not remember if when she did announce that they decided to wed this year. I was surprised and partly disappointed because the first thing that I thought was that I will never see her walking down the aisle in person, and partly I know the reason for the sudden shift. But it was only a short span of time because I understand that she wants to live in peace with the blessing of God. I just express how surprised I am, and I told her I am happy for her at last she will be settling with the man of her dreams.They will have a small wedding this year, and a big wedding next year which in the same month of July 2022.But as the months go on, she always asks me the same thing: *Why do people have the same reaction, whenever I told them that we decided to marry this year. Why cannot they be happy, they look dissapointed? Why cannot they be happy for me? do not I deserve to be happy?* I always answer her: *People will be surprised of course, because you told them that your wedding is next year and there is a sudden change but that does not mean that they are not happy. do not ever think that.* I know it is her Anxiety talking. I deeply understand, because I also have one I have had depression and Anxiety for how many years. I always put myself in her shoes. Ever our other bestfriend she always asks about it, and she just answers: *It is you and your Fiance who will be getting married, not us, not other people. Only the two of you will create your own Happiness.*I also answer the same thing everytime she asked about it. Until I do not know what to say anymore, I asked my therapist and friends who got married about it. And they say: *Tell her that it is only her that will create her own happiness, not everyone else. But we know Anxiety is a big enemy.*My bestfriend become so anxious as months passed by and at some point became bitchy. Her patience shortened and at one point she is very angry? because the Bishop is not responding through her email, and she even told me if within 2 weeks he does not reply that is it. She will find another one. I told her that she is not the only person who will get married, there is also plenty of couples who wants to wed. And because of pandemic the rules and schedules have changed, she has to understand it. And she was like: *Is this what God wants?*So after a few more weeks, she decided to transfer to another Parish, and to her surprise there are schedules for weddings, the Parish Priest told her that he is available in 2 weeks time they could wed if they want to soon. And she was shocked at how fast it is. And I told her: *There ya go, no worries in finding a Priest and you have a schedule.* And she answered me: *It is too fast and too much.*The priest asked them if they have a venue already? Catering services? Photographer? And others? and they plainly answer: *No, we do not have anything yet.*The official Schedule of her wedding is by September 18 this year. She became more anxious. I understand what they called wedding Jitters. And she still ask me the same thing: *Why do people have the same reaction, whenever I told them that we decided to marry this year. Why cannot they be happy, they look disappointed? Why cannot they be happy for me? do not I deserve to be happy? Why is it like that?*Last Friday we had that conversation again, and I told her do you want to know the Truth? I can give you answers but you have to be ready. So, I told her that the possibility is that people see it as desperation, lack of security, insecurity, something like that. And I remind her that one time when one of her co-workers commented that is she afraid to lose her Fiance something like that. And then the word **Desperation** struck her. And she asked me is that also what you think of me and \[our other bestfriends name\], is that it? And I plainly answered her: *No.* And there is another question. Were you disappointed when we announced that we are getting married this year? Tell me the Truth. I do not know what I was thinking that time but I told her the Truth that I was a bit disappointed like 50% but it was for a short time. And I am passed by it. It was a very long time ago for me, and all I am focused on is I want her to walk down the aisle. And even volunteered to process her needed papers here in our country.She told me that she was very disappointed in me because she was not expecting that of me. So all this time I was not genuinely happy for her like all of it is fake. I told her it was not, I actually felt guilty that time, that is why I want to make it up to her by helping her with what I could give. She even asked me if our other bestfriend felt the same way and I told her it is not in my position to answer on her behalf. She told me on chat that her friend in UK was so genuinely happy when she asked her if she could be her bridesmaid. And she told me it is better for me to take care of things alone knowing that people are genuinely happy rather than people helping me(which she is pertaining to me) not genuinely happy. I want to justify myself more, but she just answered **WHATEVER.** So I did not push any further, I decided that I just have to let her cooldown, I know she is very stressed out.&amp;#x200B;I contacted our other bestfriend and she called me and we talked a lot via messenger and during that time she is talking to our bestfriend in UK. She is a Teacher here in our country and her patience is kind of running out, but we have to remind ourselves that it is her Anxiety talking right now and we know she will not listen even to us. But my bestfriend kind of admitted to her that what I said about desperation kind of struck her, and somehow she thinks it is true. Perhaps?I decided to mute all my chats in Messenger because I need some time alone. And just played online games, talking to different people to shift my impending Anxiety again of what has happened. I feel like I am terrible bestfriend for that. I am also dealing with a lot of Shit in my life. But for me I have to prioritize her wellbeing. She needs me, and my other bestfriend more than ever. When I talked to my former boss turned male bestfriend I told him what happened, and what I like about his advice is that I am correct at some point but I should have told my bestfriend a **WHITE LIE. Even if she forced me to tell the truth about how I feel.** She seeks positivity and assurance. And I am the only person and my other bestfriend who can give her assurance for that. I learned for that matter more.I am just worried about her, because she is snapping a lot. Not just about the wedding but at her work as well. We told her to breathe. Last time she got extremely mad at her Fiance, because of a simple comment about the flowers. And she was like: *Who will walk down the aisle? Who is the bride? And our wedding is this year! Not next year!* And her Fiance was so afraid whenever she gets mad. That he waited outside her apartment for them to be okay. But my bestfriend just ignored her. But they made up, do not worry. Her Fiance just wants to know, what is their plan? And she admitted that we really do not have one. I told her you two to have to sit down and talk. Listen to what he says. You easily snap.At least they are okay now. And she found a beautiful wedding gown. Which is really really beautiful. But I still do not read her last message because I am thinking I might have to justify myself. Even my other bestfriend is also stressed out and worried that she always burst, she always explodes. She never cools down. I shared our predicament with my married friends and they told me wedding stress is normal, but not that much. Because they balanced things out and talk about it as a couple. I understand my bestfriend wants acceptance. She wants a wedding where everyone is happy around her not just her. She wants to be like that.....Even we told her plenty of times that other people's opinion does not matter. What is important is that they love each other.....but.....she will still ask the same question.....&amp;#x200B;I really do not know what to say. I feel like a bad person telling her how I felt before. I am sorry if this is kind of rollercoaster and long........I am just really worried. It is very hard to talk to someone with a closed-mind right now. Thank you for reading everyone. I feel like a bad person",Depression

"So I know suicidal feelings are probably the result of trauma and modern life, capitalism sucks, but most definitely a parent making you feel like you do not deserve your existence and it is definitely my case, but being aware of it does not solve anything.

I want to play with his Xbox. I want to hang out with him. I want him to help me pay a doctor and help me figure out what is going on inside my mind because my mom abused me so bad. I want to go running with him. But I cannot because I ruined our relationship and I cannot fix it, and I am afraid to fix it. I want my ex to hold me but I pushed him away too. I want to never have hurt important friends in my life, but it is too late. I want to become better at singing but I cannot bring myself to be disciplined enough to practice. I want to workout but I do not feel like it. I want to be good at my job but I am always fucking up when my boss is present and she thinks I am mediocre. I want to be okay but I do not feel ready to be okay. I am not used to the absence of caos. I feel like trying to get better is a trap. I feel like my mother's abuse started from the moment she decided to conceive me and killing myself would be actually rebelling against her because maybe the fact that I am still here, suffering, without justice for what she did to me, is exactly what she wants, but I cannot stop feeling so much pain in my soul. I am too tired. I cannot go on. I cannot do this. I want out. I cannot be fixed",Suicidal

I do not fucking eat. I do not fucking sleep. I cannot function on a day to day anymore and it is all my fucking fault.

I do not want to do anything anymore I just fucked up so bad I cannot go back I would not be able to even if I tried and I think that is what is killing me the most right now.

"Really struggling. I do not know where to begin..I have always had challenges. I have now been diagnosed with Bpd, which come with a bunch of friends; depression, ocd, attention deficit. Up until two years ago I was bumping through life, but then I lost my job, lost my house and was abandoned again! I have been trying to rebuild ever since. I tried to start training for an alternative career, then the pandemic hit. Back in June 2019 I was the closest I have ever been to taking my life. I made a promise to myself that I would wait at least one year to see if things improve. They are now worse than ever, two years on. I wished I had ended it then at least I would not have had to have lived through the suffering of the last 2 years. I am paralyzed by fear. But... I kept going, because that all I know. I re-trained into a different area, but am petrified to take the next step. I graduated with As. I have always had the security of being employed before - not doing it on my own. I would be dead already if I was not riddled with the guilt which it will leave on others. I just want to sleep forever, I cannot handle being in my own skin. I have tied to get help but have had very little, success. My last relationship has not been a good, I have just not wanted to leave because then I will have nothing. I just do not know where to turn. Professionals do not help. I have stopped talking to friends through fear of being blackmailed by my partner, who has threatened to call my parents in another country and send emails to my friends divulging very personal information.I live in constant fear and misery. For three weeks I have filled out diary cards. I have had one day, where I felt joy briefly 1 out of 10. This is no way for a human to live. every night I prey I will not wake up the next day.. everyday I wake up with a massive gasp of anxiety and affliction - as I once again reform the miserable predicaments, which are my life and know I cannot change it because I am flawed.

Now I just wish I was not alive because I hate the pain I live with every day. What happens when we die? I think nothing - its like when were sleeping except there are no dreams. I am scared of the moments leading up to death, but once I am actually dead, it will not matter because I will not know. I do not think I could kill myself because I cannot imagine the pain Id because on my mom. I love her with all my heart, maybe she would understand, but maybe she would spend the rest of her life blaming herself. I do not know why I am writing this, perhaps to get it out and not keep it inside. Who knows",Suicidal
"Tw: idk which ones to put but I feel like I should mention that there might be triggers in here.I have dealt with suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember. In fact it was one of the only things I could remember- being so young and always thinking I wish I was never born. I did not sign up for this life. When I had kids there overwhelming amount of guilt I had because I was anti-natalist.That is pretty much the only outstanding memory I have of my childhood. Any other small snippets I have were never happy or anything like that. I always felt like some bad shit went down during my childhood but I honestly thought I was crazy for thinking that. Or I was in denial because I knew it but everything.... Everything on the outside where I was standing looked so perfect.This has been driving me crazy. I have been going through my spiritual journey and along with that, for me, was realizing how toxic my parents are in the present but I always felt like I was just making things up. Overreacting. Making a big deal out of nothing.I have basically been begging my sister (7 years older than me) to tell me what happened for a while and finally, this weekend we talked. Everything that I had suspicions of was confirmed. She told me stories that I could not remember and now I can.Turns out our childhood was far more abusive than I remember. When I was 3, my sister 10 and my brother 12, my sister and I watched our mom beat our brother so bad my sister thought she was going to kill him.That was the missing piece. that is when my brain started protecting me. that is when I started repressing memories. My sister protected me. She taught me how to survive and I have been holding on to those coping mechanisms for 29 years. I did not even know what they were. I have actually been self diagnosing myself (knowing it does not actually mean anything) trying to find an answer about why I am the way I am... All because I thought I was crazy about my childhood but yet I knew there was something wrong with me. Turns out I am actually the product of an extremely physically, sexually, and mentally abusive childhood. It was a moment where I realized literally my entire personality was a trauma response. But everything ""wrong"" with me are coping mechanisms my sister taught me so that I could survive.So now, I finally have answers. I guess I feel kind of numb. It felt like I had done a 1,000 piece puzzle and my sister took off my blindfold to reveal the picture. She took my denial blindfold off.The hardest thing now is that I have kids and my kids adore my parents. But I do not think I can let my kids around these people again. Certainly not unsupervised. My parents act like they are perfectly normal people. In some ways, they are not the same people, but actually they are... They are exactly the same people, they just know they cannot act like that now. we are all grown up and now they cannot hurt us without going to jail.In a way, I feel untouchable now. They cannot hurt me anymore, not really. But I know deep down, if they felt justified, they would destroy my life. Try to get my kids taken away from me, something. They also know I could destroy their lives too. I feel numb.So now I am waiting. I am waiting on my sister, maybe my brother too, before I confront them. I cannot wait to confront them. I have so much to say. I have my anthem ready to hype me up and terrify them to compliance. They have never once, let me out of their sight because I think they know I am their greatest threat to living a normal retirement and allowing them to forget what they did to us. I am their greatest threat and it feels fucking good to know that they are scared of me and what I can do. They do not think I have what it takes but when the time comes, it will be a glorious judgement day. I just found out my childhood was way worse than I thought",Depression

"So, let me take you back to 1989. I had made a pretty bad decision in joining the USAF, as I ended up as an SP (Security Police, pretty much a patrolman), did not realize my ADHD was still there and only controlled by a lot of caffeine, and depression had been lurking in the background. I was stationed in the UK, and was pretty much miserable. My Sergeant was a full-on asshole, as were his two subordinates. Things came to a head one night while I was guarding an ammo depot. I am sitting in the shack, trying to read through a manual to help me be a better cop (as it was), and that darkness hit me hard. As a Law Enforcement person, I was issued a service revolver. Before I realized it, I had it in my hand, and was putting the barrel in my mouth. I could not feel anything but emptiness and no reason to keep living. Cocking the hammer back, I sat there, and mentally asked for a reason - ANY reason - to not pull the trigger. At that moment, the faces of my family and friends flashed in my head. I realized that killing myself was not going to end my pain; it would create pain to those I cared about. I took the sidearm from my mouth, eased the hammer back, and just broke down crying. I told my C.O. what happened, and was taken off duty and sent for therapy. Not long after, I was discharged (Honorable) and went home.It took me 32 years to finally open up and talk about that night, because I was so bothered that I had come so close to ending my life early. Sure, life has had its up and downs, but I am glad that I chose to live. It has given me an over-developed sense of self-preservation.Yes, I am still dealing with depression and seeing a therapist.

"My parents expect nothing less than a perfect ubermensch of a son out of me. They want me to make straight A's, ace college, graduate with a prestigious degree, and then get some high-paying job to make big bucks. Part of it is because they never did quite reach those levels of wealth. But the rest is just them having vastly overblown expectations.I cannot handle it anymore. I do not have any marketable skills. I am an asocial introvert with *one* friend who does not go to college. I have pretty much given up. I do not have any drive, motivation, or *anything* now.

"I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 years ago. Since then I have been working with my psychiatrist to find a medication that works for me. This past semester, I hit a different kind of low. This rock bottom state made me miss a lot of classes. I am an engineering student and even missing one class can put anyone very behind. I explained my situation to my professor and she suggested I medically withdraw from the semester. After talking with my psychiatrist and new found psychologist I decided that withdrawal was the best choice for me. The process to medically withdraw is long and difficult because mental illness can be seen as a chronic illness. The board approved my request to withdraw. This is good news. Now, I am in the process of filling out a tuition refund appeal. I have to write a personal statement about my situation. This refund is worth $9,000. Also, I can only submit this repeal once, so I want to get things right. I am having a hard time putting words together to accurately depict my dip (to put it lightly) in depression.

"I used to be okay. That is until I got hooked to anti-anxiety medication. Benzodiazepine withdrawal has changed the course of my life.Nowadays I see the world differently. I used to feel part of it. I used to feel like I had a place here. Lately I have felt like an outsider. Like I do not belong. I see people with their morning routines and just think I wish I had some structure like them. I do not have structure. I feel like an alien. Every single person I know has some sort of structure. I do not. I went from feeling like water inside a cup, to water being thrown out onto the street. My life was okay on Benzos. I could function without much anxiety. But I saw the writing on the wall. I was addicted to them. I could not do much without them, but when I was on them I was carefree, risk-taking and relatively happy. A lot of good happened in my life. I got married, was doing well at work and finally felt free from my anxiety. Something Id dealt with since I was young. From ages 24-28, I was under the influence of Xanax or Klonopin. Little did I know, with every dose, I was screwing my brain up. With ever-increasing dosages, my doctor eventually stopped prescribing them - after 3 1/2 years. I was at a high dose of 4mg Klonopin. Early this year is when my life was turned upside down when my prescription was cut off. I did not think much of it. Until a few days later when my body started shaking and I got violently sick. I did not know what was happening, neither did my wife. I started googling benzo withdrawal and found this subreddit and concluded that it was in fact the klonopin. 6 months later, I am at a lower dose (.5mg). I should feel accomplished. I should feel like I am making progress, but in fact I feel defeated. I am so tired. I am so worn out. I barely sleep and I am anxious all day. I am terrified of the real world. I have zero confidence in myself. I feel like a total loser. I could cry ever single day. I do not know what is wrong with me. If I had known that Id suffer this way due to Klonopin, I would have told the doctor to shove it down his own throat. This has taken my dignity, my will to continue and my confidence for the future. I do not know what to think anymore. So very confused",Depression

I cannot handle it and when I say something about it, they respond with: well, the works keep coming.... yeah, it is not my fault they organized themselves like trash.

"When I was younger I knew my mother was unstable. I do not blame her because she married my father knowing that he is an alcoholic who smokes weed constantly and never helps out around the household. They treated my brother normally since he is the first born but still he is low contact because of the instability of the household. For example, screaming matches and me stepping between them and me being the ""peacemaker"" and praising me for it. Not being able to use the bathroom at night, which led to some serious issues. But now I have horrible depression. Everone treats me normally now since I am an adult, and even everyone is normal and happy in a way. But it is just the trauma from my childhood still lingers and it makes me so depressed. I even developed my father's alcoholic tendencies, and my mother's ability to not handle any kind of stress without breaking down. I am failing most of my classes, but cannot tell them because last time I told them I failed one class they almost drove me to the point of driving me to the brink with mental abuse and other horrific languages. I just do not know what to do about it anymore since I am at the point where I am in between and cannot tell anyone. Called all the hotlines, talked to groups where I lived. Just depressed. Treated horribly as a child but better now? Still have serious depression.",Depression
"I have struggled long and hard with depression and anxiety since I was 17. I spent years in therapy learning to work with it and my battle hit its peak in Mar 2019. I have an extensive list of mental illness diagnoses (Depression, Panic Disorder, OCD, Eating Disorder, Complex Trauma) and I have tried almost every form of treatment out there.At my lowest point, I started having multiple panic attacks everyday. I started not being able to commute to work or focus during meetings and I was highly encouraged by my medical team to quit my job after a couple of months into my first position as a fresh graduate. I was the only university graduate of my family and my wide-ranging experiences from juggling work and study placed me in a position where I was the highest earning member of my household. My family struggled with finances while I was growing up because my mother was the sole bread winner after my parents divorced and I always had to make the most practical decisions, even when we had to move from house to house because we could not afford to pay for utilities. One of my close family members was also facing trial for a legal implication at that point and we knew our finances were tight. So even the idea of having to leave my job made no sense at all and it seemed like such an out-of-character move for me. I cried and cried, and negotiated and compromised (because I still had student loans to pay off) but I could not avoid the growing emotional debt that I owed myself. Leaving felt like the biggest failure of all and I dealt with a lot of arguments and apprehension, but I did it. I re-scaled my budget, reviewed my expenses, modified my lifestyle and I made it work. Fast forward a couple of months into intensive treatment, I received my childhood trauma diagnosis and the battle of inner conflict ensued. It took me a really, really long time to process all the violence, sexual assault, emotional abuse, manipulation and blackmail from the past 2 decades of my lifetime. And because I dealt with so much pain and struggle, I was hospitalised for an attempted suicide in Dec 2020. I felt like I just did not want to be a part of this life anymore and I just really wanted a way out (I still cry when I think about this). I survived and it felt like such a burden back then and I did not know how to process all of it, but I started learning how to set boundaries and I let people go. I gave myself time, and I told myself that if I was going to live, it would be on my terms. I gradually started working from home for one of my previous bosses after I rested and once my finances were strong enough, I moved out of my familys house (which spurred another round of conflict and guilt-tripping) with my sister and our cat, and I swear that was the best decision I have ever made.Fast forward to today, I finally spoke to my boss (who has been extremely patient and understanding about my mental health situation) and we have agreed that I can gradually start moving back to working full-time with the adjusted pay and benefits to suit. I do not share the full details of my story because there is still a lot of guilt and sensitivity about it. But at my lowest, when I was posting on forums about leaving my job and about my mental illnesses, someone commented on my post saying that he/ she was in the same position once and chose to keep working, but ended up not being able to work permanently because of his/her conditions and encouraged me to take better care of myself. I probably would not have been alive if it was not for that comment. So if anyone needs a sign today, this is it. Leave your job if that is what you need. Take care of yourself and just give life one more try. Its not easy, and if I am being honest there are still days that I wished I did not survive, but not today. Today, I am grateful If you need a sign to put yourself first, this is it. (TW: Suicide)",Depression

"It all started when covid (march 2020) hit and i got ill and a family member being admitted to the hospital all while i was about to finish high school with a bunch of late assignments. Its been very stressful but since i finished school I have been super depressed because of the fact that I am always tired and wasting time. The things i wanted to do and the passions i had for all of my hobbies dissapeared.Due to this I have been seeing myself as worthless and a failure of a human being. I cannot count how many times I have been crying during the night when my family is sleeping, thinking about how I am not doing the things i want to do let alone being productive in my life.All that I am doing is mindlessly stare at my computer screen for hours and go on very long periods of maladaptive daydreams where I am acknowledged for my imaginary accomplishments and competence. Everytime i watch anime or a movie where the main character does something cool or whatever and gets praised, i often start daydreaming and putting myself in that scenario as that character and endulge myself in the imaginary praise, recognition and approval from others. As if something is lacking in my life that leads me into maladaptive daydreaming.As soon as i realize that I am not the person I am daydreaming about i start contemplating about my life which ultimately ends me in a depressive state.I hate being tired all the time i hate being depressed and i hate this anxiety that is killing me from the inside out. I hate being with people knowing my life are not worth shit and i hate trying to explain to other people that i literally cannot do anything because of this fatigue while being a slave to my own mind. All the problems i have with my body has been going rampant since i do not have the energy and the care to even book an appointment with my doctor. I even have no sense of care writing this with empty emotions. I hate having these suicide thoughts thinking about how I am finally going to get that day of recognition from others when I am dead. But at same time not feeling suicidal at all and want to live a fulfilling life. My life is a mess and everyone else thinks that my life is going well. I have always been good at acting happy, smiling and laughing with friends and family but as soon as I am alone i start living in reality and seeing my life for what it is.I really want to help myself since i still have my hopes and dreams but with this fatigue i cannot help but wonder if I am just going to waste my life away in my own mind, dreaming about being the man i want to be.This post is just me venting the frustration I am stuck and there is no end in sight",Depression

"Went on a long walk after work. Lockdown has been going on for months. My evening walks keep me sane. The air smells terrible though.The job promotion feels more like a humiliation. Seems like I am only worth peanuts. I need to get out, but it is not like I am going to get a better job. At least my current work environment is nice. Every day, I oscillate between gratitude for the things I have during a pandemic, and anger at the futility of it all. I can barely afford to buy a place - will have to work another 20-30 years to pay off the mortgage for a shoebox in the air. Even starting a family is tough. I think I am going childfree. Money, money, money. I am working 2 jobs now, not because I am short of money, but having some extra cash, no matter how little, gives me more security. I am trying not to spiral. Maybe I need more sleep. And I need something else to focus on, a passion that could turn into a career. I did some research on grad programs and basically gave up because I am not ready to spend that money. My savings will be wiped out just to fund one degree. Even if I want to, the programs are too competitive, and does not guarantee employment or decent pay after graduation.

Everything annoys me and irritates me. But yet, at the worst point right now, i feel relaxed. I think sometimes when we are given too much control of our lives, when life is ""perfect"", we feel less happy, waiting for the next best thing. that is for me at least. My life is, objectively quite shit right now, yet i feel, as a result of a loss of control of my life, safe. i feel i can make the best out of every day despite feeling like crap.

"It really pisses me off I am sorry if I sound really blunt but it needs to be said. Having suicidal thoughts and feeling like total shit most days while seeming visibly okay/calm feels completely surreal and not in a good way. it is almost like I have to replay my previous suicide attempts/mental health crises in my head so that I can reassure myself that I am struggling and that I am not just bullshitting my problems for pity or sympathy. it is not the only reason but a big reason why there are still so many ""shocking"" and unexpected suicides because (and I have been told this by people) people think that if you see your friends and if you laugh and smile and chat to people then you cannot be depressed, lots of people think being depressed is never seeing your friends, crying constantly and not smiling or laughing. it is really dangerous.

"Hello, back in my throwaway account again...The last time I was here I was suicidal... I was so close and I am so thankful for all the people who was so supportive here. I am feeling better, but now loneliness is settling in. I feel completely alone. I am ashamed to ask for anyone's time or attention because I do not feel I deserve it. I do not deserve it, and it makes me think that maybe I do not deserve to be happy. I logically understand what is going on. But billions of humans in this world but seeing how many posts here... The irony of it. How societal norma practically fucked us over. I feel a ""fight or flight"" response coursing to every inch of my body. I want to live, I really do. I want that dash between my date of birth to my date of death to mean something, yet I cannot see it, that meaning.Fuck, I do not know what I am saying. Loneliness, isolation, it is taking every willpower in me to stay, it is taking the very last thing I hold some kind of importance, my life. I see no worth in me, no future, all I can hear is the silence surrounding me. Why were we built to be social being but be selfish at the same time? Dangit, right now all I can hope for is that this feeling that is brewing inside does not go into a full breakdown/episode again. I do not think I have it in me to reach out again. I do not want a shallow life or relationships... I do not know how to end this post. I do not know anymore. Rambling due to loneliness",Depression
So long just doing nothing. Mindlessly following a dangerous obsession. Trying to pass the days just waiting to die. Waiting for something to happen. My family will be sick of it soon. They already are. they have had more than enough. I did not sleep again. I have an appointment at 130 and its 7. I cannot miss it. Hopefully i do not. I wish it would just stop. I wish I was not so pathetic and lazy. Its true. I am looking for escapes. They do not come easy sometimes. Eagerly awaiting the greatest escape of them all. I honestly just feel defeated.

"Id like to say that I have lived a pretty normal life, nothing is really depressing about my life except how I perceive my own life. I have been diagnosed as having an anxiety disorder, so its really hard to just reach out to others because of constant overthinking, and I was also diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. I am 20 years old and in my high school years I have always constantly thought about killing myself just because I feel like a waste of a body a waste a space and a complete disappointment to my mother. I tried going to therapy genuinely looking for help and all I got was Zoloft. While still on Zoloft I still felt the same and for some reason in my senior year I completely stopped going to school and ended up dropping out, mom was not too proud of that. All I did all day was play video games smoke weed and work at a fast food restaurant. I actually started dating a girl for about 9 months which is my longest relationship but about 5 months ago she broke up with me which was okay I knew I would get over it but she started telling everyone and persistently posted saying I raped her throughout our entire relationship which completely caught me by surprise we got into an argument and the posting became consistent and most of the people I actually loved all see me as a monster that destroyed an innocent girl. I have contemplated suicide so often it no longer makes me sad and I am trying to find the absolute easiest and painless method on doing so. I guess I just need some help with this whole situation because I do not know what to do I get a good amount of threats I have already told the police of the situation I am just lost and I only see one way out.

"Every day at some point, at least once, my brain reminds me of how weak I am and how much I fail. My girlfriend is out of town for the moment and I have been avoiding telling her how I am feeling because I do not want to take away from the fun she is having with her friend in Maine. there is so much I want to tell her, so much I need to tell her. I am falling apart and its my fault like it always is, and I do not know if I can step foot in our favorite ramen place ever again. I am sorry I continue to fail and I can never succeed in being normal.For context, me and my girlfriend of almost 19 months are very close and happy with one another, but one of her best friends constantly makes me feel uncomfortable due to events in the past and how she would be dry with me but not as dry with him in our group chat (that I have been gone from since that day) It was her birthday, and she asked if I could go along with said friend, who I am uncomfortable with. I told her its your birthday, of course you can and she asked her friend to come. And she was worried before, and she asked me if I would be uncomfortable, and I told her no. And I failed her. I was so uncomfortable, the whole day I was falling apart, and she trusted that Id be fine. She trusted me and I disappointed her. For most of the day, I wanted to push myself to talk to her but as she was mostly with said friend, I could not do it, and was trying to give myself as much space as I could. I know I am such a pussy. I was falling apart and I was breaking down. I just stuck with her dad while the two of them walked around. When we went to said ramen store with all four of us I left at some point to sit outside and try to calm myself down. And later on when the day was finished we talked about the day and we talked about how badly I hurt her and how badly I made her feel, that she could not even talk to me on her day. I am so fucking sick of myself, I try to be the best I can yet I somehow fail. Its been a week since that day and were both trying to forget about the pain it still haunts me so much even though she is forgiven me for it. Remnants of that day tear me up and knock me down, and I just want to get away from it. I want to hit myself. I am sorry for everything, I am sorry i did not do enough.

But to be fair I have always been an outcast in my family anyway they must be used to disappointment. I feel like before I do, I have to convince them to not care or accept that it is truly what I want and that I think it is better for me not to exist here. But bringing it up is the hard part because obviously it would be hard for them to accept or process. Also, failing and being in prolonged pain or ending up with some sort of brain damage / in some vegetable state is quite worrying. I do not care about fitting into society nor making money anymore, the only thing I want to do is help other people and make their life better but how can I do that when I isolate and cannot even take care of myself.

"I am getting so frustrated by my situation and I cannot find a solution. I have tried CBT, talking therapy and counselling. They do not work, you can never really talk about your true problems and even if you could they do not have solutions. Really does seem like the only purpose of them is to get you going another day or for you to incriminate yourself. I grew up poor, with a black immigrant single mother (and a white father). I worked to not fall into their trap getting an education. Where I was constantly berated for not acting like a black stereotype. growing up in a neighbourhood where being a drug dealer was equal in respect to being a banker. worked my arse off to not end up as a chav. got myself into a world class university studying a highly respected field (or so I thought). Hated every day of it but I persevered. so many times I wanted to drop out or end my life, might have even done so if I did not get a decent grade. but I got through it, the loneliness, the boredom, the racial abuse. I left with a master's degree. Now I am stuck in a job where I do not get to use any of those skills. Graduated 5 years ago so I cannot even get a job in my field of study. Seeing drop outs and convicts still serving half their prison sentence in the community making more than me working manual labour. while I am here getting fat making pennies working in front a computer. cannot even move jobs because I would just have to work in the same field but somewhere else. I made sacrifices for my education and to be on the 'right' path. my girlfriend left me and 8 years on still cannot find anyone like her. Because I am mixed race I get discriminated by girls I like. Stuck in a dead end job - dead end for me because I do not want to progress these soft skills I use. Before lockdown I made so much progress in the gym even kept it up during lockdown until I had to start thinking about moving up in my career. Now I have to sacrifice many hours of my free time relearning shit I knew when I was a fresh graduate while the other goals I was working on just atrophy.

I have never lacked anything, I have not gone through any traumatic situation or I have depression or anything, I have no reason why I could explain to someone why I want to die. My will to live ""simply"" has vanished. If I could change my life for that of someone who really feels that he wants and wants to live, but cannot for any other because much more serious and understandable than mine, I would do it without thinking about it, that way I would have a valid excuse.

"I figure this could be common with a handful of people. I always have thoughts before I fall asleep. Mostly dark and it gets to be very very hard for me to sleep. I take melatonin to make me sleep, But with it I have nightmares and all in all seem to not get a break. My sleep schedule has been extremely messed up but in my own sense its peaceful. I stay awake on my phone or computer till around 7 am let us say? And only then can I fall asleep on my own because my body is so exhausted. This ends up having me sleep till 5 pm at night so I end up not sleeping during the night and sleeping to much into the day. As much as this helped me sleep better I know It is not healthy and it really does not do well for my depression because to me it is, oh it is dark outside might as well stay in and waste my life away more. But if I put my phone down at a normal time my mind runs wild. And it is a very very scary place. This part is why I have came to this group to share.

"So in my own (subjective) case, I would say it is a fight in and of itself just to recognise that you happen to be feeling the way you are feeling/thinking along the lines you are thinking because you are in a low swing and your entire perception of reality, let alone your judgement, is impaired.My brain has a habit of convincing me that something else is responsible; which usually ends up with me doing something radical like moving house, or even country, or just generally running from a problem I have assigned some imaginary responsibility to for what is, ultimately, probably just a chemical imbalance in my head.*Anyway* what I wanted to ask you guys is, when you get over that first hurdle and manage to sit down and concede ""I am experiencing a depressive mood swing."" How do you deal with it? It does not seem like something you can fight or attempt to deny, yet wallowing is counter-productive.Winston Churchill called it a ""Black Dog"" and I have read that it is useful to think of depression that way - some animal we have to cow or master, but I guess I am wondering more about techniques/your own experiences here?I can say that writing this was certainly helpful, so perhaps it does just come down to being able to articulate the problem?

He said hes been overthinking a lot, his anxiety has been rising, and he needs time alone. Cut off from social media and everything. I understand and comply with his wish.However, there is something that is been bothering me with what P said. P suggests we should distance him, and show disappointment and negative emotions towards him. P believes that if we comply with him, it will only make him take granted for what we are doing and become selfish. Basically what P wants is that he wants J to know his behavior are cowardly and disrespectful to people around him, and that he should not ghost, rather confront us.I do not know what to do. Should we just leave him alone and let him figure it out. Or we make him learn that he should not ghost, but by harsh approach. Taking initiative and confronting him is also possible, but I do not know the right timing. If you have any other approaches, Ill gratefully listen to it.

He skipped classes at university, got failed in subjects, went home sobbed at first and then quit studying then blame my parents for his own crap.... All of this shit and he refuses to grow up ,he has no fucking regard for people's well-being .I am the one taking his shit the most because I am his younger brother, so he thinks he has the permisson to yell at my face whenever he is angry, even for no good reason. And he takes pleasure in , like i said before, making cruel jokes, demeaning and belittling others, once again I suffer from this the most. And i can say he is one of the biggest blame for my mental issues like low self-esteem and confidence, which makes me fucking depressed right now. I am quite a sensitive person who absorbs people energy and being really frustrated with hurtful words. it is a long term problem that I was being unawared of for a long time, only now i realize that it is mental abuse. Things are going bad for me.So i got into a brawl with him hours earlier today. He had the same attitude , being completely denial for his action, and when i mistakenly spilled some broth and he shouted at me. I have been tolerating too long.it is like an outburst of mine. My parents going to come home later, he is going to act like the victim. I hope my words can describe how much of a cunt he is for them. Sick of narcissistic sibling",Suicidal
"when my mental health was at an all time low, i made shit decisions with people online to make me feel less empty and stuff- and now i just feel gross with myself. i still feel empty, but grossed out and mad at myself. does anyone know ways to cope with these thoughts? i mean i know its not 100% my fault because i was on the verge of killing myself, but that does not really help. i feel like tarnished and filthy?? and its making mental health so much worse and i really do not want to relapse. i feel like everyone is going to find out and judge me and be grossed out with me too- i do not really know but does anyone have any advice? how do you not overthink things from the past",Depression

"I have been increasingly suicidal over the past few months. As I understand it, it started when I watched a video talking about suicidal thoughts. They said: &gt;A lot of people have visions or fantasies of what would fix the problems in their lives. &gt; &gt;I do not have that. I really connected with that, and I honestly feel the same way.I had a really severe crush ""break-up"" two and a half years ago, and I have not found anyone since. I have only had one friend in my entire life, and we do not talk anymore.I have never been on a date before. I have not even had anyone approach me or give me any indication that they are interested.I am 26 years old. I have been in pain for SO long that I do not think a relationship would even fix it.If everything changes overnight, and I have an amazing love life and I make friends to support me, and I get married a couple of years from now, I do not care.I have been through two and a half years of hell, and NOW people start to notice me? Why now?Where were these people when I needed them?**Getting ONE date, let alone being in a relationship would defy all odds for me.****In reality, though, it is nothing special. Like, at all. People talk about dating like it is buying a new pair of shoes.** it is over.I set a date. Unless something miraculous happens, I will at least attempt suicide on October 14. I may DIE in 80 days.",Suicidal
I do not see anything wrong with suicide anymore. I feel like people who are sad about my death could just die as well. I do not know how to stop feeling this way. I am terrible. Absolutely terrible. I cannot fucking take care of my own hygiene. I cannot fucking take out trash in my room. All I do is just play video games. I want to plan my death and act on it as soon as possible. I do not care what will happen to my family after I die. I do not care if it will get better. I do not care if there is still things to do. Suicide is much easier than trying to fix myself and I am the type of person that takes the easy way out. If its a phase or a mood swing I would be even worse of a person than I already am.

"I went on vacation this week for a wedding. I was the best man. I did it out of obligation to my best friend of 18 years. I have had active suicidal ideation and rumination over negative thoughts almost daily for over a year, following the end of my own engagement.The day before the wedding, I went into a canyon trail in the Rockies some 2000 miles away from my very flat homeland. I had multiple reasons: clearing my head for the best man speech I had not finished, exercise, and I was passively searching for a good spot to jump if the desire was there.I started at the bottom of the trail as miserable as usual. It was hot and dry. Hot sand was getting in my sandals.When you get about a third through, you run into greenery and you start to hear the promise of a river. Following the trail a bit more takes you to a small stream where you can appreciate the sounds and the drop in heat. The snowmelt will be almost ice cold on a scorching day even this far down.Up the trail, it gets a little redundant again, but just as you start to resent the effort, you see another formation of rock and water or a large ancient tree. As you get to the penultimate portions, you have steep rock paths that you can no longer simply tread without using your hands, but at this point, every sight you are seeing is more beautiful than the one that came before it, so there is only joy in the effort.At last, when you get to the waterfall, the payoff seems better than anything you anticipated. The pool at the base is knee-deep. The water is refreshingly cold and clear. And the sounds are more rewarding than any music you had on your earbuds on the way there.It was like a religious experience. It was fundamentally mood altering. The day or so after was the first time in over a year where I had zero rumination over negative thoughts, not to mention no ideation. And I killed the speech according to about 20 people. I was able to actually enjoy my best friend being happy. I was enjoying the new connections I made, and I really felt like my best days were not behind me.TL;DR: It sounds cliche, but try hiking, especially if you have something requiring the right amount of payoff for your effort. it is like a microcosm of flow (the psychological concept).

Every word is just a copy and paste.Everyone only pays attention or 'gives a shit' because they do not want to look bad if I do end up killing myself. I absolutely hate it when people tell me that they will always be there for me and when I do come and ask for help or someone to hear me out, they are quick to go off and play games with some fuckwit of a person or just simply ghost. Even worse, proceed to say that they do not know how to handle it after leading me on that they are someone I could count on to listen to and whatever.

"When I was like 14 I was going through a hard time and getting suicidal thoughts like crazy, so I told my dad about it.

I began struggling with my sexuality and started experiencing gender dysphoria, and over this past year I started cutting myself.

"I am such a retarded fuck up, you know what I am tired of hearing? I am tired of hearing my school counsellor or my soccer coach telling me shit like 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Surely, one would think, if they were capable of basic human tasks, i.e. Not fucking up everything you do, the most basic of tasks in a sport, or talking to people, or giving people eye contact for god's sake, you would not **need** to **artificially** boost yourself esteem. Because you **are** capable of those things, you are capable of functioning as a social-able human. You know how fucked my self-esteem is? Sometimes, well actually, most of the time, I hate having a fucking shower because I hate seeing my disgusting retarded fucking body in the mirror. Despite being told by some that I am too skinny, or that I am normal, etc etc. I still feel and I still am a fat fucking retarded loser. I do pretty decent at school, I got an estimated ATAR of \~84 for Year 12. I wanted to be a pilot in the RAAF, but how the fuck am I ever going to achieve that if I am just an autistic bumbling piece of shit retard who cannot have a conversation with their mates one on one. I can do speeches to a class, or hell, even the school fine; but when it comes to talking to someone or having a conversation, I just cannot. I literally want to kill myself as an escape. I remember early 2019 (I think), I was plus-oned (since I never get invited to parties, not even my own friends') to a girl's party who I somewhat had a crush on (if you would even call it that, I do not think I had ever spoken to her, even to this day). Being the socially inept fuckwit that I am, I practically held on for mercy to my friend group as it slowly deteriorated as they spoke to other guys, and women who they did or did not know at the party. Eventually I was all alone, kind of just awkwardly sitting on my phone in the corner while everyone was having fun in the pool. You want to know what I was thinking while everyone was exploring their teenage lives with girls or having fun with their mates? I thought about I could smash my skull on the edge of the pool hard enough so that I would knock myself out and drown, or how I wish, how I begged that I had a gun and could just shoot myself in the fucking head. I eventually had the nerve to walk out on the party while some of my mates asked where I was going, or that they did not want me to leave. Staying at that party would have done far more harm then good I estimate, in fact I **know** it would have made me more depressed on the walk home then I already was going to be as I walked home. Why cannot I just be normal like everyone else, is it because I am an only child who spent 90% of his childhood staring at the wall or watching TV on his own because no one was ever home? Is it because I was a fat little fucker throughout the entirety of primary school, and how being picked on for being a fat cunt has subconsciously impacted by self-esteem? Or was it that time in 2019 when I got completely dacked doing a pullup on the oval infront of the entire fucking school? (I was already a social anxiety-having fucking retard back then.) Holy shit typing this just feels good man, wow. Do I have asperges? I do not fucking know. Do I have social anxiety? I do not know. Am I just shy? I do not know. Do I have depression? I do not know. I hope I do not but I kind of hope I do at the same time so I have a reason to be so mentally fucking defective. All I know is that I have fantasized about killing myself since I was a 10 year old, and NoFap has merely granted me more time to think about how badly I just want to kill myself. How bad I just want to buy a gun, or join the army and just shoot myself in the fucking skull and just obliterate my existence from this Earth. On that note, I am not like most people who say they have ""Given up on humanity"" and how they are ""turning their back on humanity"". Because I am not angry at society or humanity, I know I am the issue, I am the defect. I am so lonely and I love this solace, this hole that I am in, this melancholy. It feels warm, cozy, it feels like I belong here and it feels like I am here to stay. I do not give a fuck anymore, I just want to die. Maybe I will regret it when I do kill myself one day. I am just so tired of being an autistic little fuckup loser. Sometimes when I get mad at myself or I feel stress, I just like to rant in my head how I am so much a fucking fat little cunt f\*ggot fucking loser, it feels good. Sometimes I like to pretend I am holding a gun to my head (or in my mouth) with my hand and just pretend I am pulling the trigger and that I will not be here anymore. I remember when I was a little younger, I used to go sleep, making a prayer (Eastern Orthodox) and just pray that god will kill me or end my life. I am just listing my thoughts here so if this feels a little disjointed, I apologise. I just wish I could be normal, I wish I did not hate the very existence of my being, my body, my stupid ugly fucking face. I wish I could look people in the eye while I talk to them. I wish I could talk to people. I wish I could talk to girls, I wish I could feel **not** lonely. I have done research on how to do those things, and it just brings me back to where I started. 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Just read that, kind of liked how I brought it full circle. I know other stuff about helping my social anxiety and stuff, people say just talk to people or talk to strangers, even just shallow talk etc. and it will get easier. Sure maybe it might, but I do not want to have to try man, I am so fucking sick of having to strive to be average instead of just 'being average'. I do not want to try, I just want to kill myself and not have to bother, just give up. Some of you reading that message above might be a bit smug and say, 'then do it, nothing is stopping you, just do it, you are just going to be another statistic.' Do you really think I care about being another statistic? If I had a gun, I would have already killed myself lmao. I would probably be dead in the pool or on the couch, I do not fucking know. I am listening to some Radiohead and just writing these things while putting on a good album of their just feels right. I will wrap it up here, how the fuck are people cocky? How are people arrogant or become overconfident? I want that shit man, surely it is better than every thought you have in your brain is either a plea for suicide or a neutral thought which manifests itself into a negative one. Anyways, that is all I can think of for now in my smug retarded essay. Comment what you guys think or something so I know my block of text did not go unnoticed.

"After years and years of people's bullshit, I have just became a bitter and closed off person compared to when I was a kid. Constant bullying, constantly being ignored or belittled, constantly being seen as not important, stuff like this make me really despise everyone I meet. Usually people say I am grumpy, or I have anger issues. They usually say I need to be a happier person and be nice to others. Well to them, MASSIVE FUCK YOU . I am tired of constantly being the lighting rod of being looked down up and seen as a bad person when I am reality all I get is nothing but negative comments like racist or sexist slurs towards me or not supporting a belief or having doubts on an opinion. Yet they expect me to roll with the punches and shut up. I should give happiness to others when all I get is mental abuse and insults. that is why I despise happiness. I cannot bare to see someone happy because it reminds me of how selfish people can be. Even people who accomplished something makes me feel like shit because it feels like they are flexing the accomplishment when I am miles from them. Yet they expect me to cheer on the sidelines. It saddens me alot to see people in relationships or get opportunities while it feels like my life is on fucking repeat by eating and shitting. And if anything goes wrong, it is always my fucking fault. Dog hurt there paw? My fault. someone is tire gets flat, my fault. Someone is about to be robbed? Well guess who is fucking fault it is. I do not even need to be involved and somehow, everyone loves to put the blame on me. All these traits that people reflected onto me just make me wish for suicide sometimes. But I am too much of a pussy to do that. Instead I just reside to my own thoughts and being my own parent and comfort myself that others failed to show. that is why I hate being happy and that is why I refuse to give happiness to others when over the years all I got was hate and bullshit and disloyalty. I hate being happy and I despise giving happiness to others",Depression
"HeyI think this is going to be sort of long but I need someone who does not know me personally to read my thoughts and give me advice on a few things.The first is that I think my views on society and even myself are getting changed by my friend. I am not going to get into detail as to what type of views, its not important, but I think because I have such a big need to get along with everyone and not upset anyone that I sort of just go along with whatever. The second, possibly bigger problem, is that the person I am dating, once straight and heterosexual, recently told me they are non binary. While that itself is not a problem, I am straight and I feel like its not fair to either of us to stay, but they make me feel like I have to. They always feel suicidal and I do not know what they would do if I left them. It makes me feel like a shitty person and I do not know what to do.Another problem is I am religious, I believe in God, but some of my closer friends and the person I am dating does not. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable sometimes and I do not like what the talk about sometimes. Of course, I keep my mouth shut but it makes me feel worse in the end.Yet another thing I am having problems with is figuring out who I am, Id there is any purpose of my existence in this Earth. I do not know what I want to do, I do not know what I am going to do. I just graduated high school and I am going to college. I almost feel like I do not want to, but its too late to back out now and even if I could, I would not know what to do. There is other stuff but I guess this is all I want to say right now.

"The thoughts have come less the past few years. I am normal by other people's standards. The wounds have healed. But I still want to die. I gave up the razors and bleach and whatever else I could swallow that I can get without a prescription. Maybe I got soft?

"I will make it simple. I have a long distance girlfriend for over 4 years. My family has gone through shit, little sister died very young, dad cheated on my mum etc...I have serious mental issues. No I would not say I am mental but I am struggling with depression, honesty and motivation for years. My girlfriend has always been a support to me but lately she is been more of a mum to me. It turned kind of out of control and we decided to have a 2 week break. I do not trust her as awful as it sounds. I know she will not cheat on me, but I am scared she would find someone better than me, because I know, I am a piece of shit. After 1 week of not talking, I sent her a message, because I could not cope... Now I read and clearly everywhere says, if you go back to the girl before she wants you to, it is messing up everything... So now, it is obvious in a week, she will tell me to fuck off. I cannot face that. I want courage to finish this. All I search on internet gives me suicide hotlines. I do not give a damn shit. I am a loner, no one talks to me, I have no friends and the only person I would talk to is my girlfriend. She told me, ""you know you do this for us, keep strong for 7 more days"". I have never felt so rejected and I just thought to myself. No one gives a shit about you, it is you against the world. I am a believer and I want to be with Christ rather than stay here on this shit earth. I am not sure what keeps me alive",Suicidal

"For a little background information I have been severely depressed or all most a year now. I have been to several therapists, been on multiple medications but it all has had little to no change in my depression. To put it bluntly I am just tired of living tired of feeling sad, lonely,lost, hopeless tired of I all. I see no point in trying to get help when nothing is working. I am think I am ready to leave the world honestly. I am about to be a senior in high school and the thought of having to go throw a nother year of online school makes me will not to vomit.

Knowing that if I load it the way I did last night and put the barrel to the roof of my mouth, I can end my entire life in one last bang.It would have been peaceful if I had gone all the way. I was out in a field, the moon was full and bright. It was chilly. I was in pain from my thoughts, as I always am, but it was nice being in control. It was nice sitting without any worries, without any anxiety, for just a few minutes. I shot my gun for the first time last night.",Suicidal

"I wake up everyday thinking the only choice I have to end this numbing emotional and mental pain is to kill myself, but I have a child so I do not want to kill myself so I have resulted in hoping and wishing that if I accidentally get hit by a car or whatever and I die, it will not hurt those around me as much as it would if I committed suicide.A bit of a background: I had my child at 13, have my GCSEs, Alevels and a Degree. I have my own home and a job and such a great kid, like I am baffled at how amazing she has become.But I am tired, in every way, in every level and in every depth possible. I have a job that kills me mentally and emotionally and my daughters dad (who I am not with) makes my life difficult.The place where I work makes me cry on the way to my shift, during my shift when I am alone upstairs for lunch and I reached breaking point and cried during my shift to my deputy manager because I felt they was on my case all day. But I did not admit that working there makes me suicidal... I mean how can I? I decreased my hours at work 7 months ago as I was struggling so much with juggling the shifts and childcare, and I went on depression meds. I thought it would get better, but it has not. No change of hours has changed the fact that make me miserable. I tried and failed.My daughters dad, well can be a good dad, but picks and chooses when he wants to be. I have to travel up to 4 buses a day every two weeks to get my kid to her dads (as I do not drive) and back and the same again on the Sunday. At times I have to call other family members to do it for me as sometimes I am too exhausted to do it (especially after a fulls day work) and on the odd occasion he brings her back for me on Sunday or picks her up from a family members house but never actually from her school because he works and all that crap as if I do not. And when he does have her, he does not even take care of her, his mum does. he is in his room on xbox, at work or at football or seeing his girlfriend. Because he has a life and I do not as you can see.There is a lot more about why work and my daughters dad makes me miserable but its both long stories.The tipping point is work asking me to come in or to find other people to look after my kid if my child is off school isolating. I am a single parent and my work place keep asking me to palm my kid off to other members of my family or whoever while she is supposed to be isolating so I can work. They know all my family members work, they know my mum has COPD, they know one of my brothers kids (my nephew) has an autoimmune disease, and they now know that my daughters nannie ( dads mum) looks after 2 disabled kids. Does my manager and deputy manager still ask for me to find other people to look after my kid so I can work? Yes.I have finally rang my doctors to get an appointment for a sick note and I will hopefully find the courage to write up a resignation to give to my workplace too.Will I find another job? I am not sure because my workplace has made me so stressed, feel so worthless and feel as if I am too stupid. I feel like I cannot do anything anymore. I do not even feel like myself anymore; I feel so lost.I am lost. I have tried my best but I just feel that this is all there will be.",Depression

"This is what they call a scapegoat personality. My father was one too. He was murdered and his whole estate was claimed by the government as ""proceeds of crime"" (innaccurate) - he was a multiple legitimate business owner/workaholic in the 2000s. It was by corrupt police that did not want him bringing information forward about them at his appeal. His confiscated assets were in the millions and years later I was told he was tortured to death in the desert two States over(right before his appeal date). He died before being able to show his innocence/expose the corrupt cops trying to extort him and regain his work and assets. He essentially worked his whole life from 4am until sometimes 12am (so all day/night and then some)at two different busy and lucrative legit businesses and provided employment to others not just for nothing, but to be spat back at in the face by all of them. As well as miss out on his own and his kids lives.I have been physically, emotionally and psychologically abused by my other parent as a child and every partner I have ever had (it never happened until they had me in a place where I could not go back or escape or when there were not witnesses). I tried to buy a house with my current partner just for him to use me as a stepping stone ""use"" being the keyword and everyone else has shut me out. I have not been in contact with my old friends or remaining family AT ALL for the past two years. My siblings are messed up by our parents but are Unhealthily codependent on our mom and scapegoat me in an unnecessarily psycho way as a display of ""standing up for mom"" or you could say rage denying that she was abusive af as long as it was not being directed at them... Cool.My partner since I was 21uses me to run around for his drug habit and would force me to do the deals while abusing me out of jealousy for the people I had to speak to to get him his drugs but he will not sort it out himself or help me. And he also then threatens to turn me in to the cops as blackmail for doing his drug deals when he feels like sneering down at me or is being abusive. he is also scary af and unpredictable (or should I say predictably abusive) when he does not get his drugs. He takes my house keys off me and kicks me out (I am part owners of the house not even sure if that is legal i told people this and no one cares he just says I am a drug dealer and they think he has a legit reason lol) and I have no one and no where to go. I just did a job trial and an educational course for the last two weeks which was government funded (same government that took my dads whole life away) the teachers were hella old and out of touch but ready to jump down your throat as if we are all feminist militant vegans ready to complain about anything and so this course went 14 days we did fuck all real learning and played games like hangman and they gave us ALL the answers to the assessments. all of them. It was a waste of time and a joke and probably a total of 15 minutes practical experience on a forklift which was the main reason most of us signed up to the course. They cut the course short and have not even booked an instructor/assessor so fuck knows if we are even getting qualified after that bs. My job trial on the last day the boss made some weird comment about my CV saying ""everyone lies on here"" (I think that is what I heard?) Nothing on my resume is a lie and even if it was there is no way they could or should know that they just did not trust me and had something weird in their head about me from the start. Not sure if they know my last name as same industry my dad was cleaning up in 15 years ago and they love shitting all over someone they were once jealous of. He was dyslexic and left school at 14 but just charging every day.I got ghosted by them but idc that much if I did. I almost prefer that to someone scapegoating me for something I have not done to make money, again. Forgot to mention I was really anxious bc I was told I could not take the day off the Forklift course the day of my job trial and I nearly cried multiple times sitting in class while they played hangman no joke and a legit crackhead on meth got to come back from the last class of students to take up our teachers attention the whole day while she sat at his desk and he essentially did her assessments for her. She was not trying man she probably did not even come to class during her course and she got special treatment to come back and pass. At one point teacher made an example of me in front of the class for giggling politely at the person next to me joke about might as well go home instead of play hangman... As if I needed to be taught a lesson in front of the class and this methhead chick while he ignored our class all day to help her cheat. I really want to complain to my employment agency who set me up with this course as we left at least two hours early each day and I am pretty sure they were funding this. If I did not waste my time going the last day I might have been better prepared and successful with my job trial if I had not been stuck there having anxiety and playing hangman while we watched the teacher pass a bad attitude chick on meth the whole day. I find when you are a scapegoat personality what you do does not actually matter. They will bend over backwards to block and cheapshot you while they help people who do not challenge them, their position, or their intellect in any way. ""The identified patient""",Suicidal

"I wish I could just sigh and release everything but to be honest, all I really want in this life is to just be loved. To have someone who can actually touch me, most times I associate that with romance. &amp;#x200B;But it has been so long since the last time someone even touched my skin. The last time was 3 months ago and that was a mere millisecond of contact during a routine checkup. The nurse accidentally touched my arm for a brief moment when putting the blood pressure cuff on. How sad is it that I remember that after 3 months?!&amp;#x200B;That was the only physical contact I have had in nearly 3 YEARS and you wonder why I am constantly thinking about suicide? Is it not obvious?&amp;#x200B;I just want to know what it is like to receive affection on a regular basis. But it is too much to ask and I know it is. I cannot do ""slow"". Not only have I been cut off from physical contact, I have also been cut off from social interaction with pretty much anyone. &amp;#x200B;I do not know anyone where I live, I only have my brother and our relationship is more akin to roommates than anything. Seeing as how I am just a caretaker for him really, since he refuses to do anything for himself. &amp;#x200B;I frequently think about just getting out of here, away from him because I am not his fucking housewife nor his maid. But if I do not cook, then we do not eat. If I do not clean, we get infested with gnats and flies. &amp;#x200B;Seems every day is just the same. Wake up, try to figure out how to make my own mind a bit better, sit around, cook dinner and clean up and that is about all I can muster. &amp;#x200B;This life has taken so much from me and all I have ever asked for was love. I have never cared for possessions nor money nor anything else, just love.&amp;#x200B;It was a nice ideal while it lasted, I suppose. Because in this world, love has to be the last thing you want. You got to want the money and the job and the possessions first. cannot really function in society without those things.&amp;#x200B;And yet, even as I have grown older, I still do not want much of anything from your world. 99.999999% of it is completely and entirely useless. &amp;#x200B;Just basic stuff, you know? Like a phone, an internet connection, a cooler, a place to call home, a TV, some form of entertainment like video games or whatever, a bed, really simple things. You could toss in some gadgets if you like baking and stuff and throw in a musical instrument or whatever but you get the point. it is a very minimalist type of lifestyle. &amp;#x200B;How ironic, I suppose. I try to live with the least amount possible and by doing so, I have the least amount of people in my life as well. Who would have thought?&amp;#x200B;I try to change, I try to convince myself that I can change. But I am still stuck here, in this reality and I cannot lie to myself. I cannot redirect my thoughts nor shift them, it is all the same as lying. &amp;#x200B;In honesty, I just do not want anything anymore. I want to want, but I do not want. The motivation is not strong enough to get me out of my head. I doubt much of anything ever could be.&amp;#x200B;I have tried EVERY SINGLE THING I could find. Breathing techniques, bridging negative thoughts, cognitive behavioral therapy, I am even currently in therapy, I am taking medication every day and I suppose that is a +1 for me. I am starting to kind of build a morning routine and I am starting to take better care of myself but none of it is making any difference!&amp;#x200B;I am still alone!! I am still useless!! I still have not been touched in an ungodly amount of time!! I get the slightest hint of attention and I am like a fucking lost puppy! I will follow you off a fucking cliff!! &amp;#x200B;None of this is factually making anything about my life better. I am still miserable, I am still addicted to video games and YouTube and now Reddit has fallen in along the lines so I guess you all are just going to need to ban me. So I can do ""more constructive things"" with my life.&amp;#x200B;As if I want to be cleaning up this fucking apartment that my brother has no problem in trashing but will barely lift a finger to actually help!! And it is just EVERYTHING!!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to do all of this and be this person that I am not and I have to do it all alone because I am so fucking worthless and I have made some real shit decisions in my life!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to have hope when someone comes into my life for a brief moment and then leaves after I pour out the darkest parts of me. &amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to believe that things can get better when I am not seeing any real results from anything I am doing. My teeth are getting a bit whiter, so I guess that is the only real plus there.&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to integrate back into society when the smallest amount of attention makes me feel like I am going to explode and if that gets cut off... You can kiss all this progress goodbye. &amp;#x200B;I have been starved for most of my life. In one way or another, or multiple ways. But I cannot ask people to understand that. I have to be the one to change and I cannot make that change without experience to back up the habits and since I am so damn sensitive to attention because I am so fucking starved, people do not want to connect with me. it is a fucking self fulfilling loop of neverending negative feedback and experience but I am supposed to just be ok with it. &amp;#x200B;Yeah, it is ok. it is ok.

I miss being a kid so fucking much when i did not knew how fucked up the world is I am 17 and i do not feel life its for me i have zero interest in getting a job because i know it does not matter if i get a job for the money or because i like it both will suck eventually I have no friends irl because i lost a bunch of friends i had because we had to move to another city I have no interest in getting a girlfriend because i know love is not for me i do not think anyone will love me because i suck with any social related stuffI hate school because is pointless I am just learning some shitty facts to get a number going up and get a pointless job just to work like a slave just to make rich people richer and then lay forever underground But when i was a kid i just cared about friends family and videogames i was really happy now i realize how much life sucks and how pointless it is to even try But I am not even strong enough to kill myself because my family would get sad and i would feel like i wasted my life and their time i really just want to be happy but i find life so pointless and empty i would like to just dissapear like i never existed or just be dumber and be another dumb teen that just exists and its happy with the way society works Every night i lay down for 2-3 hours just thinking about how happy i was before i realized how shitty the world is I envy ignorant people so much what should i do ill end up killing myself eventually i need help i really just want to be happy :( I miss being a kid life its pointless and i suck as a human being,Suicidal

"Hi, Every since covid hit I have been struggling with being sad all the time and depressed. I was 13 when it started and have not been the same since. The problem is usually the reason I am sad is because I am super insecure of my weight/how I look. I also never go out with people I used to because I break down because I hate how I look. Everytime this happens or I am depressed for a few days I eat way to much, its basically a viscous cycle that happens all the time pretty much, some days are better then others but always bad. I was wondering if anyone have any suggestions on how to stop eating a lot or how to loose weight, or even have to love myself what ever works. If anyone else has struggled with this and has found a way to cope that would be great to know some tips. Over eating",Depression

"I have been trying different antidepressants recently (mostly SSRIs) and everytime I quit taking them in the first week or so. I just cannot handle the side effects - severe dizziness and this overwhelming feeling of inner unrest. So after doing some research I found St. John's Wort which according to one meta analysis I found, is as effective as common antidepressants but with much less side effects. ""Thirty-five studies examining 6993 patients ... evaluated St. Johannes Wort (SJW). The herb SJW was associated with more treatment responders than placebo. Compared to antidepressants, SJW participants were less likely to experience adverse events with no difference in treatment effectiveness in mild and moderate depression."" [Study]( looks really promising to me. I am currently taking about 700mg a day and I only experience very mild inner unrest here and there but nothing major. I hope to God that this will finally help me a bit. I will definitely update you guys if you wish. St. John's Wort is severely underestimated in my opinion",Depression

"I am sitting here after my first week of my new job, I got a raise but I am not excited. I scrub toilets now.. my car was carjacked about 2 months ago with me in it a month after purchasing it.. throwing myself from the vehicle we lost everything we had with us phones, bags, some identity etc... after 8 months ago my last vehicle was stolen from my apartment complex one morning .....a week after purchasing it.. This is no exaggeration. And you may not know me.. I was a full time college student till covid 19 forced me to drop out due to my learning disability preventing me from taking online courses, the school had switched to all online learning and I have fallen behind due to fear of affecting my grades and learning opportunities.. also not having a car was not going to work.. I was going to school for medicine, sociology and criminology. I want to be a surgeon or a drug rehab specialist with a psychology major.. I also act and model and make music for my dreams.. I want to change the world and bring my creations to millions to enjoy but also learn from and be strong from. To inspire.. i want to be a good person,, I I a good person and I do not understand why everything is so dark.everything is against me. I am so tired... one thing after the other. . I can barely stand waking up in the mornings.. I bought blades and lidocaine because I am just tired. I am falling back into my had habits like not eating and obsessive little habits are creeping back into my life.. I am having nightmares and I can barely hear what people are saying to me.. delayed reactions and my slouching is worse than ever and I can feel it hurting me but I cannot care enough to force myself to try and sit up. it is starting to make my GI issues worse yet I cannot convince myself.. I am sick and disgusting every day. My GI issues are annoying and make me feel like scum..I cannot even go days without vomiting or getting sick from stomach acid and weak.. My mom is basically killing herself slowly. She drinks 2 pints a day and chain smokes and is currently suffering from some sort of internal bleeding while skipping a surgery she needed last year and is counting on death. I am left to clean up the messy house when she does not and the bills have fallen behind to an absolute bomb.. I am 23 and I am the head of house hold.. I cannot do this anymore. Her old abusive narcissistic habits come out when she is drunk and she snaps at me or shuts me down. And my whole body shuts down I feel stupid and like I am not myself when she triggers those old things.. I was homeless last year 2x and before was evicted from our family home when my mom divorced her fiance of 15 years one night in the garage, he then got us kicked out of our home because he was so vindictive. And now he is keeping my brothers away from my mom and me. We have not seen them except maybe 4 times this year when the court order says they have to be here a % of the week. My boyfriend is ignoring me every day now.. after I spent nights with him holding his head up scared of him O.Ding.. he pops in and out and now will not listen to me when i complain about what needs to be fixed.. he will not visit me when his father said he would be fine witv taking him to my house while he is at work so he could spend a few hours over here every other day.. but has never once taken the offer.. he did not show up for my birthday.. or our anniversary and I am falling apart. As I write this I feel suicidal and he is not here for me.. our date was tonight but I have not spoke to him in 15 hours.. he did not even tell me we were not doing to today and now I am just hurt because i did not even get an update. And he was not even going to be actually seeing me he said it would be a virtual date. But we live in the same state and he is treating me like a long distance Xbox girlfriend... My friends left the state and I have been canceling projects.. I have been laying in bed sad and barely eating.. even the weed is not helping. I hate myself. I cannot even remember what I look like on a good day and looking in the mirror is unbearable, covered in scars and cannot even finish school. I cannot even keep a car or keep my partner interested in me. I am a whiney fuckinf bitch. I feel CRAZY because I cannot tell if my partner is stringing me along or actually just going through something.. and I feel like I am mean and wrong for feeling the way I do. Like I cannot even speak to him because he does not even look at me when I tell him he is not being very attentive to me or the relationship.. sometimes he does not kiss me when I ask or pulls away from me.. we have not had sex in almost 10 months it was one reason and now it is another.. but he is asked a girl in the past for inappropriate photos.. if he was excited to see some random photo why cannot he be excited for me what is wrong with me.. he does not even touch me like he used to.. I cannot even call him he does not ever pick up for my phone calls when i call him.. he even tells me he lost his phone some times... he does not work he does not go to school he plays Xbox and never leaves his mom.home and plays with online friends? But is too depressed to talk to me i feel like I am the problem and everyone hates meI'm honestly just not wanting to be here any more and it is really starting to hurt me.. it is like the world is pushing me to take my life and I am really starting to believe it.. I was supposed to fucking die as an infant maybe it is true :( have not felt this low in a while..",Depression
"I am not suicidal but the thought of it is nice. But if I had the opportunity to rent a studio apartment and vegetate in it, I would.I would go to work, order all groceries and essentials online, including clothing. I would turn off all the lights, lock the door and shit the windows. I would keep it clean and never talk to anyone unless it was absolutely necessary.I do not feel like a failure because I am a logical person who knows that there is no such thing as a failure or a successful person.At the end of the day, I was born with shit genetics, to a garbage family. I no longer care about myself enough to maintain my health if shit hit the fan.If I got cancer, I would let it kill me. It is simply not worth the effort.All of my hopes and dreams have been crushed. My health is deteriorating for a while now for no reason (I am not going into detail about that so please take my word for it) and I have never really gotten anything I wanted in terms of making progress towards the dreams and passion I used to have.Life sucks. I wish it did not. I am only 19 and I cry every night thinking about what could have been and what will not be, from a purely statistical and reasonable hindsight perspective. I am not the type to lie. I almost never lie and I am just being realistic.I do not enjoy anything anymore, I do not make goals or plans anymore. I do not want to be around anyone. I do not want a family. I do not want friends. I do not want a loving romantic relationship. I do not want pets. I do not like people, which is ironic, because I hate myself and I am finally realizing I dislike other people more.No offense to other people, of course, but I just hate human interaction. I really do. Maybe I am just sleep deprived and rambling but I cannot name a single time I have ever truly been happy without some sort of dopamine releasing drug. I mean, sure, when I was a kid and still enjoy video games I laughed and giggled, but that was not happiness.And ya know what, I do not even care about happiness. I cannot remember the last time I was truly *content.* To be content is to be able to sit on a bench, without any stimulation from an external source, and to be able to say ""woah. Life is pretty cool, I guess.""Yeah. Never felt that way and probably never will.Some will call me lazy or a loser, but from my perspective, life is not worth the effort. This is going to sound harsh but I do not even believe in love. I never tell anyone I love them. Not my parents, family members, past friends, etc. They always get so mad but I do not have it within me to fucking say that shit. it is so far beyond my functioning that I feel fake as fuck saying it.But then other times, I question if I really do not love my parents. And for the most part... Well that is where I am going to end this.I am not happy. Life gets worse and I am not counting on the grass being greener on the other side. I am not going to be one of those people that cheers myself up by putting other people down. So I save money and wait to afford apartment. Then I block everyone and sleep and work.

"Please help me idk what to doThe guy I (21F) like has been severely depressed for almost two years now. There have been times he completely blocked everyone out of his life. Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i break, especially since he has been so emotionless since he started meds.Last time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions? I feel guilty and frustrated all the time. My friends even tell me i am a clown for texting him. I know its not true. But after two years i am doubting myself.Thanks Help pls..",Depression

They did everything right. Every time you showed me love and kindness was only a reminder that I did not deserve it.

I am a bad investment. do not think you did not offer help, you did, and I refused it over and over because in the end I do not want to get better, because I deserve to die from the rot that eats away at my brain and poisons my thoughts.

I always thought I would just leave without a word, but you know enough about the losing battle in my mind that you deserve some semblance of an explanation. I am so sorry, for everything.

I doubt my relationships, feel broken and worthless and I cannot pin my inner rage to anything in particular. I was molested by my uncle as a young boy which has likely fucked me up in irreversible ways. I am in a long term relationship with a woman and am unsure if I truly love her or if I am settling because I hate being alone and feel I cannot do any better. I do not know what to do or how to improve my psyche. I am seeing a therapist and taking medication but it does not seem to have much effect.

"For the record, I am not suicidal and I never have been. But I am going to tell you something, a true story, that might make you think another way.For background, My mom's friend, who I will call ""Susan"" speaks Russian and English, so she works in translation at hospitals in the you.S.Susan had a client, who I will call ""Sandra"" was living in Russia. Sandra's son, living in America told her to come live with him there. She at first declined, saying Russia was were her friends and job were. But after a while, she agreed. But when Sandra lived here, she fell in a deep depression. She did not fit in, she did not like her job. She would spend a lot of time just watching TV. Sandra starts feeling suicidal, not caring about life. Always saying she wants to die. She becomes isolated, smoking and occupying her time with herself. Smoking a lot. After a while, she visits her friends in Russia. They tell Sandra they are worried about her cough. Sandra brushes it off as a little side-effect of smoking. Returning to the you.S., Sandra's son expresses the same concern. She says the same thing, but they decide to take her to a doctor. Inoperable, Incurable Stage 4 Lung Cancer.Instantly, her whole attitude changes.The amount of time she spent hating life, not caring, she regrets it. She realizes how important it is, and what she has. She has a few months left to live. And she appreciates it so much more.My point to you is this: I do not know what you are going through. I do not know how you feel. But I know that if you push past pain and try, and maybe you will have to try hard; to try hard to appreciate life, you will enjoy life. You will not regret hating life and feeling like you do not matter, like Sandra did. Because like her, you will come to regret it.I hope this reaches out to you, and guides you to a better place.

"Firstly, I just know that I will not ever be able to transition to how I want to be. I will not be able to get top surgery, or hormones or whatever because that shit is too expensive and I can barely make enough money to pay rent as it is.I do not have insurance, I am struggling to make money, and I barely have any skills that I am proud of. I am walked all over by everyone I know because I am a people pleaser. I just want to snap at everyone one day. I want to isolate myself from everyone I know. I just want to stop existing in the eyes of everyone I know.I try to ground myself, do that stupid coping skill shit, but it just does not work. Medication does not work for me either, I have tried. Therapy maybe worked for a little bit but I never really got to the things that I really needed to get through in the 3 years I went. Maybe I should become an alcoholic as soon as I can legally buy alcohol. It runs in the family after all. I do not see any point in trying so Ill just throw everything away as soon as I possibly can. I do not even know how the fuck I have gotten as far as I have in life. And I am barely scraping by. I often have fantasies of the train tracks near my house. Its only a 10-15 minute walk to get there. I think about putting my head onto the tracks, listening to music, and closing my eyes. The only reason I have not done it yet is because I am scared.The only reason is instinctual self preservation. And I hate it. I do not have the balls to just up and leave in the middle of the night because I feel like my roommate would figure it out. Or maybe not, idfk. Maybe if I just pretend everything is fine for a little longer I can leave without a trace, and no one will notice until its too late. Hopefully it would be successful so that I would not have to deal with hospital fees. Tbh I do not think there is any coming back from a train crushing your head in anyways.

"No, really? Why have we have a species survived this long? I do not get how people can just live like this without killing themselves.

I get exhausted so easily, and cannot really do much for more than a few hours without feeling like I am going to pass out, and it is so frustrating. I was taking caffeine pills to keep me awake at work but they did not do shit. Maybe it is a medical thing, or because I am autistic, or maybe I am just fucking lazy. I dunno, but whatever it is, it made me sleep for 16 hours straight after returning from my first shift. I tried to kill myself the night after my second one. I kind of wish I actually wanted to die. I used to, when I was younger, but I did not really have any means of doing it. Eventually, I taught myself to find things worth sticking around for, no matter how small they are. But it backfired, because I feel like I have no choice but to kill myself, because I was born into a world I am not cut out for. Now the things that previously were keeping me here are just things I have no choice but to leave behind, and it hurts more than if there was just nothing. Does that make sense? No? let us move on,I am stuck relying on my parents for the time being which I hate because I know they just see me as a leech. They try to sugarcoat it but it is obvious that my dad resents me and I am just waiting for the point where he cuts me off financially because I know it is inevitable (especially due to the fact that I am trans and closeted and they are both far-right wackjobs who are a few Facebook links away from thinking the Earth is flat.)So having any long term goals or aspirations seems really pointless, knowing everything can all get sucked out from underneath me the instant they find out.Ok I am tired of typing now. going to go pass out. what is the point?",Depression

"I suffer from both extreme anxiety and depression. Well, this is one of those nights where I am having suicidal thoughts.&amp;#x200B;I am aware various hotlines exist to help. The problem is, my extreme anxiety will not let me make use of any of them. I am so scared at the thought of talking to people over the phone. I am scared and anxious to even reach out to anyone for help. I am just going to get ignored? Maybe not, but it is how I always feel. The horror stories that I have read about hotlines not picking up make it worse.&amp;#x200B;I constantly feel like I am a waste of space.

"I do not see a point to anything anymore. I believe I have identified it as apathy. But as far as I can rationalize it I exist on this planet to live for an arbitrary reason, and then die. Full stop. I cannot find meaning, I have been trying so fucking hard but I just cannot. I have everything I could want In life but I find joy in none of it. I used to love gaming, and travelling. As of the past couple years I have not felt excited for either in any capacity. I have not felt anger, happiness or sadness in what feels like a lifetime. All I am experiencing is boredom and apathy. I am not even sure if what I am experiencing ***is*** depression, but from what I can tell, its at least a form of it. I have been to therapists and psychologists, I have tried CBT. None of it has worked. I am trying to avoid anti-depressants but I hate the sound of the side effects, especially the ones related to sex. Sex is one of the last things that distracts me from what I am experiencing, although I am afraid I am developing an addiction to it. I am not even suicidal. I just feel so jaded and tired of living. But I do not see a way out. Being dead seems worse but I do not know where to go from here. I am a conventionally attractive, young, college student who is been in a stable relationship for 5 years with a gorgeous, amazing girl. And I am absolutely depressed beyond reason.",Depression

I just think not many people in my circle, perhaps anyone, is really ready to have that conversation, even those who know of my feelings and thoughts. Of course, people are dealing with their own issues, especially during this pandemic, I just cannot help but feel like I have been going through these episodes of depression for the last five years. Five whole years of contemplating suicide. I am not alone in how I feel, but it never ceases to seem so isolating and that I am truly alone. Even getting a full time job did not make anything better; it dawned on me that this will be the rest of my life--wake up, work, eat, sleep. And everyday what I want to achieve and pursue seems that much farther away. Life cannot just be this, or else what is the point? It seems as though the most feasible way of alleviating this malaise is just ending it all, never needing to worry about life again. It never really went away",Depression

Do I have a symptom/am I crazy?Okay so I (14F) have a sister(16F). And were pretty close like really really close. Our mother passed away when we was younger(she was murder) . 7 and 5 years old. So its really just us to against the world. My sister is really quiet and does not talk to no one. While I on the other hand is completely the opposite. But ig after my mother passing and other shit happening. I have this feeling to protect my sister from everyone and everything. Like I never been away from her for more then 3 days. And if she does not go then I will not go and vis-versa ( sorry for bad spelling) but yea I am usually the one to do everything(which I have no problem with) and I always keep track of my sister to protect her from anything and anyone because I do not want to lose her. ( our dad is not in our life) but whenever my sister goes to work we share locations so I check it every 5 minutes. Because every negative possibility fills my head that something is happening to her like she is getting murdered or something. She understands how I feel when it comes to her for the most part. But then a lot of times at night I go into her room and just cry because I cannot stop myself from thinking someone is going to kill her while she is sleep and take her from me. And I just watch by the door with something sharp. Waiting for someone to try to take her from me. And she is knows and she tells me nothing is going to happen but I cannot help it. Like she is mine(my sister) I cannot let anything happen to her. I have no memory of our mom. But all I know is once I saw her in the casket. I vowed to let nothing happen to my sister. But I think there something wrong with me because sometimes when I am by myself I just talk out of nowhere forming a plan to kill anyone that try to hurts my sister. And it feels like someone is talking back to me . But I do not even care I just want to keep my sister safe. So is there something wrong with me? Please help me.,Suicidal

I going to make it the best year that I can so that on my next birthday my choice will be clear. Maybe this is my last year that I will be here. Maybe this is the start to something amazing. I honestly do not know. I love everyone in my life and I do not want them to be sad, but if things do not work out I cannot stay. it is stupid, but I do not want to grow old alone, I know I joke about being the crazy old guy in the woods but I do not want that. I want a family with the person that I fall in love with. I want a house and a yard so I can watch my kids (whether they are ours or adopted) grow up and hopefully be the father I wish I had when I was little. I want to go on adventures with someone and be able to have those stupid little moments where you know you have each others back 100% or you look in that person's eyes and you know they love you. I feel like my chances are all but gone and I do not want to be here if they are. Whenever I hang out with my friends I feel like the creepy old guy.

I do not want to die alone but I think I might have to and it is better to do it earlier rather than waiting around till I am 35 or 40. it will give people time to forget about me. This is all stupid as fuck. It all comes down to being alone and my brain not being able to handle it. Maybe I am being punished for the horrible shit I have done, whether it is a God, or the universe or something else I really do not know.

"I have been feeling pretty weird and detached. My boyfriend and I just got through a series of arguments, we both apologized to each other but I still have a hard time being close with him because of my own internal issues. it is hard for me to feel close to anyone right now. Stressful events always send me into a dissociated state it just depends how hard. Recently, on top of this, I was physically assaulted by a drunk guy. did not even know it was coming, I think that was the most jarring part about it. He was another resident of the house I am currently living at and pretty much harrassed me passive aggressively from the moment I moved in. My weight has dropped so low because my appetite is gone from stress. I am approaching under a hundred, its very bad but I just cannot make myself eat. I have such an intense sense of dread that it makes me feel like I am going to die soon. Not even suicidal, just that I am at the end of my life if that makes sense. I get weird panic attacks where I am inconsolable one second, and then I pop back pretty much normal the next.

"I used to feel empty inside almost all the time. it is like a void inside which seems like non-fillable but few months back I decided to do something about it. I did not want to feel like crap all the time. So I started on self development.I started small like waking up early instead of sleeping till 10 or 11 am and letting my depression and sadness sink in . Then when It became slightly bearable, I started programming again (I used to be good at it but my depression took the fun out it). I admit this was a hard road since I was out of practice and when I was unable to code. I used to think how I wasted so many years being depressed and thus subconsciously slipping into it again.Again I had to pull myself together.This feels like never ending process since I have been depressed half of my life (I am 23M :p) but atleast I was not that sad anymore.So six months down the line.I am brushing up my maths (important for programming)Working out few times a week.Learning guitar (bought it years back but you know depression)I have still social anxiety and I am social awkward but that is another days problem.

I had several mental breakdowns that made me alienate the closest people (personal and professional) around me, and dropped out of two promising graduate programs as a result. After being hospitalized and put in the psych ward I cannot even buy a gun to end my suffering when no one fucking cares. Anyone I tried to reach out to (first time in over a year) have ghosted me. So I deleted all my photos and contacts permanently... I just do not want to exist anymore. I am alone and I just want the pain to stop.Now living with my mom for over two years now in my late 20s (soon early 30s, although I think I will definitely end my life if I have to suffer that much longer) and the end is not in sight. I am trying really hard but I cannot seem to reach the next step... I got a part-time job that pays well but even that small amount of work terrifies me. I barely manage to make it through the week without impulsively jumping in front of a car or off a balcony. I am afraid that I cannot do anything right anymore. I literally forgot how to talk to people and be a normal non-suicidal person. My therapists recommended that I get an emotional support puppy but now that is just another expense that I have to keep up with. And I basically burned all bridges with anyone who would write me a decent reference letter.People keep telling me that I am going to eventually scrape my way out or that I can start fresh again but I do not want to start fresh again or scrape my way out of this shithole.

Like drinking so much coffee that you do not feel energized.

Too scared to hunker down and take care of the things that would make my current job better, yet too scared to push forward.My situation is not much different, but I have that inch of progress I have made in the past few weeks.

I have plenty saved but I just get concerned about having trouble getting a new job if I quit one out of the blue. that is my irrational brain, so concerned about keeping a job I would drive myself to an unintentional suicide, maybe intentional if it gets worse.Guess I got to just fight for that next inch of progress. Apply some more places and get the hell out of here. Change cannot come fast enough",Suicidal
"I have been depressed since 2016, when I entered university. I always had high expectations in my life and thought the next thing would be my break. I have moved to 3 different places since then and am now in doctorates school and thought it would be done. I am constantly drunk, hate my life, and am completely alone. My family does not talk to me, my friends do not talk to me, and my boyfriend does not get me. How do I go on? I am on medication, consistently for 2 months now, and nothing helps. I have no will to keep up with this. When does it end?",Depression

I cannot explain it, I am laughing but I can still feel my depression being vividly present and bold.Today, I overslept.

I mainly do not feel as if I have anyone to socialize with. there is periods of time where I feel like I am breaking through and I am about to have real friends and then something always happens to change that.Weird thing is, I am not alone, I have been in a relationship for a year and a half but we do separate things. Not that we do nothing together but in terms of socializing with other people we do not. He has his crowd and I have the outskirts of mine. I am not young, on the back end of my thirties and this desolate, alone feeling has never ceased. I live in an incredibly social city and I still cannot seem to find my place. Lately I am just more and more heartbroken over this, I am starting to believe I am just a loner. Therapy has not helped this aspect much. I do not have a clue anymore about any of it.

"I miss my Danish friend. We met on reddit, he saw my post at r/selfie and came to talk to me. His name was Michael, he said he worked in Germany. He was a pansexual and had some lovers. He wanted me to be his lover.We were similar in personality and hit it off, he could fully understand me, even my slight sadness. I have never met such a person in real life before. We got along very well and talked about everything. I trusted him, he liked me. He was like another soul of mine. He also said that I reminded him of his past self. He was always gentle and considerate, just like a band-aid, covering my pain.However, from the beginning to the end, we only knew each other for about half a month. My days are numbered, so I said goodbye to him ten days ago. He did not respond to my message. But I am not disappointed, because this is his behavior style.Strangely, since then, I have never dared to review our chat records. As if suddenly, they became deserted ruins, overgrown with weeds, which seemed to be unreal.I cannot even think about how happy we used to be, and occasionally I shudder at the thought. Those memories have sunk into the darkness, and Michael seems to have completely disappeared.Yesterday, I went to talk to him again. I know, no one will respond to me. But, I am dying, I just want to find a place to talk to myself. However, when I wrote the first message, I suddenly collapsed. I felt like I have returned to an abandoned home, with old furniture still in place, but people were gone.I sat on the empty bed, trembling, waiting for his appearance. I felt like I was writing to a ghost. I expected him to hug me, kiss me, comfort me, and stretch out a pale hand and touch me in the dark.How unreal online relationships are. Are all the stories of your lovers true? Does your voice, my name written on your hand really belong to a man named Michael? Why are you so hesitant when I want a picture of you without a beard?I am weak and have a headache. it is raining outside. Today, I am going to commit suicide.

"Hello, I am a 17yr old bisexual male in india. The last few months I was feeling really sick but did not have any symptoms, so my friend asked me to take a couple of psych tests and they all came back saying I am moderately depressed or severely depressed. I have been feeling suicidal for about 3years now, ever since I faced bullying in my old school and was hospitalized for liver failure because I tried to kill my self with pills. This was 3 years ago. Every thing since then has felt extra. I lately have not been able to do anything about it because of my studies. I cannot seek help because if i tell my parents they will simply discard it saying it is an excuse not to study (they are wired that way) and I do not have enough money on my own to seek help indipendently.

Going further back, my parents divorced when I was 14/15, and my sister passed when I was 16. I flunked out of college, had a solid hospitality career and now have a solid HR career where I make decent money to take care of myself. I used to be one of those people others said was beautiful, but I have gained 110 lbs since high school (I am 60 but that is still a lot) and I just feel disgusting but cannot get the weight off.

"A few weeks ago Vladimir Putin said this to a reporter when asked if there was an increase in trust and happiness between him and Biden, and I cannot stop thinking about it.I do not think I have ever been happy, and the illusion of it even being possible has disappeared already for me.I was abused and neglected as a child and teenager, and had to raise myself, alone, from 16 on. I regret my suicide attempts that left me hospitalized then were not successful, as slightly more than a decade later I am just as miserable, but have no optimism like I did then.All I have wanted out of this miserable life has been to be loved, and after a lifetime I thought I found it. I learned another language, saved several thousand dollars, gave up all my worldly possessions, my pets, and moved to the other side of the planet to be with my spouse, who decided they did not love me, but only loves me like a friend. Now I sleep alone in a bed for two, in a life devoid of happiness and meaning, all before the age of 30. I have no home to return to in the country from which I came (I was just born there/grew up there, I feel no attachment to it anyways or desire to return) and I will always be a foreigner where I now reside, struggling to make ends meet in a developing country.I have managed to save several dozen different benzodiazepines to mix and take with a bottle of spirits once I finally reach my breaking point which I feel is soon. If I could tell a younger version of myself anything it would be that life does not get better, and to just give up already.

"I (M20) had to end things with my girlfriend (F20) of 1 year. She had to move to another state for reasons beyond her control, and I am definitely not in a place in my life right now where I could drop everything and move with her, even though I would in a heart beat.This happened in January earlier this year, now it is almost August and I feel no different than I did the night she left. I actually feel worse. I loved her so much, and she loved me the same. If we had broken up in some big fight or something, it would have been way easier to move on, because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for, something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her, we even said ""I love you"" to each other. We truly loved each other, we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on, but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it. If I stopped talking to her all together, I would really feel like I would lose her forever, the one person who made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And I just cannot. I cannot stop thinking about her, and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore, movies, video games, exercise, nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep, and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys, and even though I know she is not that kind of girl, it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her, it would finally kill me.The worst part is, I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life, and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her, now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel, it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me, but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again, and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back, and she has her own life somewhere else now, it really cannot happen, at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then, I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here, but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen, and I keep telling myself that, but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone, I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TL;DR - I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do.

"how do you all, seeking here, not sure what for... (27yoM)I have been having difficulties with my mental health for some time now, but I feel it is reaching new depths - I am now more happy to spend multiple days in bed, comfortable and bored, than out of bed; attempting to progress, in any sense. I suppose it is far more comfortable to be low than it is to be perpetually anxious.I feel like I have read so much of the self-help literature out there, so it is obvious to me what must be done to pull myself out of this slump, ie; take responsibility and be accountable for yourself and your movements; recognise that suffering is a part of life and can be a useful tool; be aware of the things you are feeding yourself, both physically and spiritually; maybe create some sort of goals in a written format that you can regularly go over to keep you motivated and help you manifest; learn to love exercise, stretching and breathing; possibly explore some creative endeavours; be kind to yourself etc. (the list goes on). Over the past 6 years, I have sporadically tried to form healthy habits based off of the latter values and techniques, thus attempting to take responsibility for my own happiness, however, with each consequential failure, the more hopeless I am becoming - it has gotten to the point where I am doing the bare minimum, just to pay for rent, leaving me financially exhausted with little room and/or energy for healthy activity.I have also sought help for GP's and got in touch with a couple of psychologists - GP's have given me medicinal options, which have either proven to be unsuccessful for me in the past, or risk the danger of becoming heavily addicted, for example, to benzo's (I have a very addictive personality and have had ongoing issues with substance abuse, namely alcohol and marijuana). I have found therapy, so far, firstly to be difficult to attain, and secondly more homeworky (mood journals, document sharing, technique applications etc.) than is useful for me - this is my own fault for not properly following their advice, but it just has not been resonating with me.I feel like I have a lot to offer, but am having difficulties finding where I may apply myself. I do not care for money, to the point where it is reckless, but I would like to find a vocation where I am fulfilled. Because I have no certifications or qualifications, the roles that I am able to work are generally hospitality based, physical labour, or just general shit kicking - this does not cut it for me, and I find the little work I am performing, I am performing utterly miserably, spending most of the time in my head, cursing myself. I cannot sustain a lifestyle like this - I am in desperate need of money, but more desperate need of fulfilment. I am so lazy, but I am exhausted. I suppose I am looking for any thoughts out there, even may they be alternative and outside of the box. I am aware that this is not an isolated issue, so I suppose it is important for me to find insight in community.Be this a very broad explanation, it is the best I can surmise of my emotional state, for now.

"I feel like a lifeless body moving around. This summer, I tried everything I could do to be productive. On the bright side, I have established good habits that were not there before. But at the same time, I get frustrated when I lose the streak of tasks and forget to follow through with these good habits. Even though some would say that I have 'grown' as a person, I still feel like nothing has changed and that I am worthless until I am able to actually stick to something. I do not even have the motivation to fully explain my emotions because all the energy is sucked out of me. Lately, I realized how narcissistic I am for craving validation when I know it is not the best driving force. 2021 is possibly my worst year yet because it feels like there is no reward for all that I have done. Was all this pain worth it or am I just running in circles? In need of a virtual hug right now",Suicidal

"I am not happy but I am not sad, I am kind of just living. Its been this way for probably the last 3 years but recently I have had a little bit too much time to think. My family is toxic and just full of negativity, I have always know my life was kind of shitty but i used to think it will be better when i distance myself from toxic people but with this more time to think about life do to the pandemic I have realized that may not be true.My mom and dad split before i was born.My mom is a selfish person who did not really care about me or my brother, so she shipped us off to our grandmas house, My dad, well hes a drug addicted who also live with my grandma (his mom) My grandma while she tries her best but she is simply not a good parent. she keeps clothes on our back and a roof over our head but when it comes to raising a child she not the great, long story short I have never had anyone to really raise me, teach me life skills, and discipline. so i feel like i was kind of fucked from the start.Not to mention that my social skills are absolute dog shit. I am too awkward to get into a relationship, and i do not really have friends only a couple acquaintances that i send memes to sometimes. I also have no skills whatsoever that could carry me to a good life. i have no motivation or dreams, so I am basically just wasting space.

Everything that entertains me somehow, only last for a little bit of time and I am so tired of having a consciouness. Time seems so slow, last week seems like it was ages ago and I am inpatient. I set myself to die when I am about 40 because I do not want to live too long. For the first time in a couple of years I have an actual friend but I fear she might stop talking to me, because I talk about the same shit over and over again and use her as a therapist but I just cannot help myself, nothing exciting ever happens in my life.

"I need supportive people in order to recover, but my trauma takes everyone away. Those who have stuck with me have become so used to my crying and panics, that there is nothing they can do or say any more. They tell me to keep trying, that it will get better, that I can do this -- but I cannot do it on my own. I need people to talk to me and comfort me, but everyone backs away when my pain is at its worst. I know it must get exhausting to reassure me when things fall apart, but then please quit telling me to keep trying. Please quit telling me I can do it. I am in so much pain, I do not want to keep doing this. I do not want to keep trying. I do not want to stay here for longer. Sometimes I am hurting so much, it causes people to ignore me or leave for good. I cannot handle any more abandonment or rejection. I am alone right now, my pain is extreme, and I am alone. I have no one here. I am alone. I am going to die by myself.I have had professional help, and it feels like those experiences have only set me further back. So then, I do not know who I can trust any more or what I can do to get better. I have tried so much but my health only gets worse. I will be trapped in these memories forever. Just let me go.

I am also highly self-conscious as I am big, fat and ugly, therefore hate myself however I have recently been trying to work out with little success.At school I act fine, and make friends laugh yet I am in pain, I need to talk to someone and I have been giving hints to one of my friends yet I am not sure he quite gets what I am hinting at. it is just good because school takes my mind off of some things but it also creates more stress through homework and exams.I also think about how I barely see my dad and when I do I just here spiteful comments yet I got to love him, he is my dad after all. This really takes a toll on me because I wish I could have a stronger connection with my dad and makes me think about how lucky some people are for having their parents together.I always think about ending it all but then that thought gets me emotional because I do not want my sister or mum to go through the pain of me being gone because I love them both with all my heart. I am only 15 and I do not want to be alive, but I do not want to be dead either. I wish I grew up in another generation, my generation is fucked and all this technology messes with us.

Through all the years the only thing that kept me going was belief in my capabilities, but now I honestly do not feel like I want to live anymore. I have lost the drive that once resided in myself. I have given up on my fantasy of success. There is nothing that I want in this world anymore. I am pretty certain that nothing will ever make me happy again, no matter how big or small. I think I have been completely hollowed out.Perhaps a last ditch effort can be made by running away, living on the street and turning back to substances. Perhaps it shall invigorate something inside of me again, but I honestly cannot see the point of trying. I do not see the point of having to live anymore.Even though I picture killing myself all day, I cannot put those around me though that. I have just been living with this hole inside of me, getting emptier as each year passes.I feel terrible every single day that I have to subject those around me to my sadness. it is hard because I know they try and are there for me trying to pull me out, I just cannot see any possibility of it happening anymore.I am sorry Empty",Suicidal

To her credit, she is a genuinely curious person, but that is not how it works. To be a good ally requires that you are being sensitive in handling the conversation.

"I will make it short, it is late for me.I absolutely love school and other activities, I am (kind of) the ""popular kid"" in school, teachers love me since 1st grade, I have never been in a fight and always get good notes, I am smart, talk a lot and even offered myself as a teacher.And now, what is the problem? Well, I will try to make it even shorter.I am the only son of my family, I have no brothers... well, I have got two siblings, but they almost never come close to us unless they need money for spending in some shit instead of studying, so that leaves me as the only one in the house, and, to be honest, I always fantasize about having a sister that comprehends me and that loves me (as a brother, fcking obviously), that would care about my problems, that would help me in my life and that would talk to me, but the only thing I have is a dog that is too old to go for a walk.To add information to what is above, I always wanted a real friend, someone who is there for me, for talking or hanging out, someone who likes the same things as me and does not ignore me, like many friends I have, when I want to talk, all they do is ghost me...To finish this thingy, I recently fell in love with someone, a very cute girl, shy, likes almost the same things as me, she is perfect for me, I evem walked with her to her home once, and she liked it, I am planning to talk privately with her to compliment her, and try to demostrate that I want her to be 'more than a friend', But I am afraid, afraid of scaring her, afraid of being alone with no love...The reason why I am posting this here is because no one'd listen, no friends of mine would keep a conversation about this without ghosting me, this is my only place to open up to some people.

I only leave my house to drop off packages after people buy cards from me on ebay. I have tried going on walks, picking up new hobbies, playing with the family puppy,etc nothing has really made me feel happy just make the day end faster.My mom keeps asking me when I am going to get a girlfriend and that she wants grandkids she says it occasionally it feels kind of insulting to me. She tells me that I am handsome,etc when I am a fat dude and a below average face with mental issues.I want to get multiple cosmetic surgerys which I am saving up for with the cards that I am selling and with a job I can possibly get if my interview goes well.

what is it mean when two separate psych doctors agree that Suicide is a valid option for you. One after working with me considered it for himself as well. The other said in a way she will not go to jail but still clear enough she thought it was probably the right choice.Cuz no one I ever met really got a good defense then oh they should not say that well if they are willing to commute career sepuku and risk life imprisonments over it for someone they have a business relationship and otherwise fully stable and have decade plus time practitioning . They must know something No one risks their own career and life for something their soul is not ok with and not a stranger unless they know they are right or certain about their decision. I Think we are so wrong about being so anti suicide because let us be honest. there is no real evidence its wrong that can stand logic Even doctors know suicide is not wrong,Suicidal

"I wrote this on the bipolar reddit this morning. well now i do not want to exist. I cannot do what i want to do because i do not have the mental stability. I have nobody to talk to about this shit. I only have family. Well that is not enough anymoreI cannot succeed in school but i have to in order to not become homeless. I cannot get a job at 21 years old because I am too socially anxious. I am just worthless. I want to hire a hit man to kill myself or something. I just want to die but i do not have it in me. I feel like an attention whore. I am so drained I am looking up the same shit i used to at 14. I take xanax for anxiety and i wish it sedated me but it does not. No matter how much i take i feel the same. I have taken 16 mgs at once and its done nothing to me. I just want to feel nothing. I want to be out of everyone is life. I make people feel shitty and it fucking kills me. I feel like I am trying to crawl out of my skin.I have been taking 100mg seroquel for four days. I am in a weird situation right now and its really difficult to explain but I am going to try. My dad met someone on minecraft about ten years ago and long story short, they hit it off, became friends, and started a business together. She lives in australia and we live in the US. she is married with a kid and she is been really nasty to my family. She is in control of every aspect of his life; finances, has camera with audio in the living room of his house (they own it for air bnb together), Gps on him, and has tried to buy the love of my brothers and I. Well for a short period i lived in that house rent free which i appreciate. I got kicked out after a manic episode and have been exerting all my engergy trying to get back into that house and pay monthly rent instead. she is decided that she wanted to create a plan for success but its all under her terms. On day four of taking these meds i realized i do not want to live under her roof. If I am going to pay to live somewhere then it makes more sense to me to spend more on rent elsewhere due to the emotional turmoil she is put me through. I am 21 years old and I think that this is the end of the road for me to try and repair my dad and is relationship. He has let this woman that i just found out hes romantically involved with (which to me makes everything far more twisted) someone who has hurt his family so much. This devastated me so much. I want to know if this is me thinking for myself for once, or an impulsive thing. I have had to live at the house i was r**** in for two months while she decides if i should be allowed back. The reason i was kicked out due to a manic episode was because i wanted to go to the hospital for inpatient because i had not gotten a wink of sleep in nearly a week. My dad started telling me how stupid that would be because of i went to the mental hospital she would just kick me out. Its so sick and i do not think i can be in my dads life.

"It has been a few months passed since my last entry on this reddit. My art project did not went as expected and my relationship with my model will not go for a very good place... I tried different projects to see If could find something where I could surely prove my talent, and although I may have found something, it is just simply not enough. Every moment of victory is simply a distraction to my own insignificance, it does not matter if I find a job, managed to make an incredible artwork; in the end I am still alone, unsuccessful and unhappy. And seeing people around with your age winning and being happy is just too much. I am done, my envy and shame cannot take it anymore and I already accepted that it is too late to fix things, if there is something to fix right now it will not be enough. I dreamed a good young adulthood for me, but since I am already a young and unhappy adult, I do not want to get to the 30's anymore if it is to go on like this... So, I give it up. I made my decision, I will not pass from 25. I still have things to finish, but once it is done than I will go for it. The only important questions are the how and the when. I pretend on leaving in a quick and painless way, preferably one that is not messy, since I do not want to scar my relatives so much. I know my death will bring them misery, but hopefully my suicide note (that at this point has became a manifesto) will ease their pain, it will not make it go away, but it may help them to make the grieving process quicker... It will happen, no doubt. The question is only when, how and what will be left behind...",Suicidal
"I have been in and out of feeling suicidal for a few years. Feeling suicidal as in creating a plan, practicing that plan, waking up most days wanting to go through with it, seeing items and thinking about how I could use them to off myself, and so on. I have spent two years with a therapist going over trauma,anxiety, depression, and everything that goes with it. there is been times that I have felt the light shine through, like I was able to work past the bullshit and experience reality in its real form. But I am once again in the low, and once again, it hurts like a motherfucker. Its worse with each major low and each time I feel like I lose another piece of myself. At this point I feel like a husk of who I once was. No drive, no happiness, no goals, just basking in self loathing. It sucks and its no way to get past what I am feeling, but I am trapped in this mindset. I no longer feel remorse for who I leave behind. I know the pain is immeasurable for those who have to suffer the loss of a loved one, especially from suicide. So much greater than my personal hurt but I am fed up. I am fed up with the person who stares back at me in the mirror. Its pathetic watching myself move through the days.

"I am severely traumatized and in the lowest throes of depression. I could fill a book with experiences that would horrify the average person. It is truly remarkable that I am alive, and life is something that I hate to no end. This is a trigger warning, because even though I would probably despise you, I respect your membership in a ""moral community."" I am going to vent some things that contribute to my depression. do not read it, straight up. To preface, I am not some 14 year old kid struggling with new emotions. I am 31, and I have experienced pretty much exclusively low points throughout my life, interspersed with extensive, mind-destroying misery that nearly killed me several times. I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that 99% of humanity is sinister in nature, and wicked in their actions. I hate you, very genuinely. My entire being is consumed by an unquenchable hatred for my fellow human being. I was not always like this, though. I was a nice kid with a big, loving heart, even though my parents were meth head trailer trash. My innocence was systematically stolen from me over the course of my early years. I learned to hate, and I eventually lost my ability to trust other humans on any level. I literally cannot maintain any relationships, and I live in complete isolation, waiting to die. I had early childhood issues with abandonment that made me feel like everyone was going to suddenly leave me. I was not wrong. People are shit, and they will stick around as long as you have something that they want. You, the person reading this, are like this. No matter what you think about yourself, you are not loyal to anyone but yourself, and you probably do not even know it. Only broken people can truly understand the ramifications their actions can have on others, because they were once victimized by another's selfishness - their willingness to use you to attain a need or desire of some kind. In order to *truly* understand that, you have to have experienced trauma. Real trauma. Not ""I got a spanking when I was 10."" The kind that actually fucks you up forever. *trigger warning for people who cannot validate my experience, while simultaneously expecting their own experiences to be validated* You, at the grocery store, staring at my ragged clothes and greasy hair, please go fuck yourself. Leave me alone. Mind your own goddamned business. You, in the car trying to run me off the fucking road while you text on your cell phone, I hope you crash and your car bursts into flames. You, neighbor, slamming your fucking fist on the wall whenever I walk across my house - whenever you do this, I have a panic attack. I imagine gruesome things about you, and all that separates us is a paper thin wall that I could crush through with my bare hands. Fuck you. If you knew my thoughts, you would move. You, the guy who stole my car a couple months back. I hope terrible things happen to you in prison. You, the employer who stole thousands of dollars from me and my employees while I managed your company and literally kept it afloat through 2020, I hope your fucking business goes under and your family goes hungry. Fuck you. I hope your mansion burns down. I could go on forever. I despise you all with all my soul. I just had to say some of this. Keep in mind that I do not care about your feelings, and I do not seek validation. I feel nothing but hatred and sadness.",Depression

"I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and mild OCD (alongside symptoms of PMDD but it is hard to get a diagnosis; my psychiatrists are male). The purpose of this post is not to ask what treatment would necessarily work in my case, rather to ask if there is still hope to find an anti-depressant that will remove my paralysing symptoms (low mood, constant fatigue, executive dysfunction, etc). My overarching issue is that I find it increasingly difficult to study for my upcoming GCSEs and I understand that my grades are not worth my mental wellbeing but I live in an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive household with parents that might just marry me off if I am unable to escape by studying abroad; I need to study if I want to be emotionally stable and independent in the future. Though it seems the drugs I have been on (Paxil and Lexapro) never seem to help enough, they might make me able to get out of bed and have the energy to socialise on mediocre to good days but I cannot put myself to work and critically think (I also need constant distractions or my obsessions/intrusive thoughts get the best of me) as to study. Has anyone had a similar experience where the use of another antidepressant has helped them to work long enough to fulfil their responsibility as an employee/student? Should I stop searching for help in antidepressants- is this a dead-end?TL;DR: If neither Paxil nor Lexapro work for me, a 15-year-old, is it worth it continuing to search for antidepressants that do?

"First off, I was in there with a guy who stayed 3 extra days because the psych forgot to give him his heart meds and switched him to Seroquel to see if his dizziness would go away. The dizziness was from her accidentally forgetting to give him his meds. That should be enough to tell you how neglectful these places are.When I was 18, I called the hotline. I said I did not want to hurt myself but needed hell. A cop knocked on my door while I was in the bathroom and took me to an ambulance ($250 fee) and then to the hospital (got a bill that hopefully was covered by insurance) and spent 24 hours on a gurney before they decided I was not a danger to myself or others and let me go. The day after my 22nd (July 2nd) I was on a multi-day alcohol bender and attempted (pills). Cops showed up and I was not compliant (kept telling them to leave me alone) and they kept questioning me and standing there. Apparently they were afraid of me ODing but did not bring in an EMT. Eventually they put me in handcuffs without even saying ""you have to come with us or we will put you in handcuffs"". They also came in through the side door and unlocked front garage door which I am pretty sure is illegal. Outside I remained compliant but kept asking why I was in handcuffs. The guy cop then frisked me and touched my penis twice and after he did that I said ""you just touched my dick again"" and then he put his finger up my ass. I am serious. He degraded me in front of my entire neighborhood in broad daylight. 0 reason to. Then they put me in the backseat of a squad car and I kept asking why I was in a car in handcuffs and kept repeating I am not going to harm anyone and they said ""because you told us to fuck off like 20 times"" and ""we are doing what is your best interest"". Riiight, not rushing me to the hospital...? I think I might have been illegally detained because I did not commit a crime or make any threatening gestures and the sodomization was 100% illegal.Eventually they decided maybe the kid overdosing needs medical help so they had me get in the EMT, and they strapped me to a gurney. I have no idea why they did this because I was not fighting at all or acting like I was a danger. I kept asking and they would not give me an answer. Eventually I made it to the hospital. I had my blood drawn a total of five times. I waited in the ER for 5ish hours and then got sent up to the floor for people that attempt and act out and whatnot and it was AWFUL. Close second to jail, I assume. One room with nothing to do and nothing in it, shit food, a hallway leading to two TVs and a group room where you spend 2 hours a day max. No counselors, social workers are there but rarely see you (saw mine on the 5th day, was supposed to be every day), and a psychiatrist sees you every morning for only 5-10 mins.I told them that I was a prescribed Xanax addict over and over and over again and they would not give me my prescription to help with withdrawals. Withdrawals from Xanax and alcohol are extremely dangerous and can kill you. I had two seizures in there. They gave me Ativan after my first seizure ""well, just let us know if you have a seizure"" and for the next few days none of the nurses knew what was going on, or the psych. I kept telling them about my withdrawals and they said ""you are not going through withdrawals, it is a benzodiazepine, it is the same thing"". I was crying, I felt so defeated and that I would die in there. If you know how benzo W/Ds feel, you know what I am talking about. Severe psychological distress and physical pain. 3 days in I lost control of my arm, my back was arched and lost control of the muscles in my face. I could only whisper and this nurse laughed at me and walked away. She also told me my convulsing (felt like my back and neck were about to snap) was just a panic attack and I needed to relax. I had a seizure on the floor and the nurse said ""if you flop on the floor like that, I am not going to give you any benzos"".The patients were also traumatizing. It was awful. Just imagine a psych ward, it is just how you think it is. Met a pedophile, a violent methhead, a tiny meth girl who would masturbate on the phone all day, a couple fucking, violence between patients and security/police, emergency calls, etc. and yelling all the time. did not sleep more than 3 hours a night after I got a new doctor (because my psych forgot to see me one morning) and he was more or less like ""what the fuck are they doing?"". I want off Xanax so bad but it is so difficult to kick and I am so paranoid and anxious and this experience added a layer to my PTSD and my paranoia and anxiety are at an all time high. I am so afraid and I am even more depressed. The only good part is that I am coming up on 30 days sober. I feel like I was treated like an animal and I feel... I would usually use a lot of words, but I just feel like a robot. I do not know what to do... guys, be careful Guys be careful with the hotline and do not ever end up in a psych ward, even voluntarily",Depression
"Depression sucks, I think we have all established that at this point. I want a hobby. There are so many things on my life that I get mildly interested in. I spend weeks dwelling on how to begin a hobby before eventually losing interest on even starting ot convincing myself that I am not going to do good at it so why bother. Or, if I am lucky, I try it, and enjoy it (looking at you crochet) and then lose interest in two days. I want to learn Spanish and now would be the perfect time to learn it. Where I work we have a lot of Spanish speaking customers, and a lot of my coworkers speak Spanish. I could get a lot of practice, and there is no better time to learn it than now. Except my brain is so stupid. I feel so stupid, I cannot remember anything, or focus on anything for any amount of time. Not only that, but I am also terrified of saying something stupid, or looking like an idiot. To be fair to myself it takes years to learn a language, but I have such a thin skin right now. Yesterday I went for a walk around my neighborhood. It was actually the first time I walked around it in a long time. Nearing the end of it I got whacked in the face by a bee, jumped, swatted it. Right in front another person. I felt ridiculous, like I was swatting at nothing like a crazy person. Trying to save I face I remarked that ""I hate bees"" with an awkward laugh. She awkwardly chucked and walked away. Instead of being proud of myself for going for a walk alone I spend that rest of the day feeling like a dumbass. I do not hate bees at all, bees are lovely little pollinaters who help the planet, but now this women on my neighborhood might see me again and think that I am the crazy chick who hates bees.I want to backpack Europe one day. And I keep thinking that I am never going to do it. I am worried about it being another regret in my life. I could have done it but never did. Just another causulty of my depression.I want to go on more hikes. I want a friend to do it with. I love walking but I do not like going on walks by myself. I am still nervous about it, and honestly it is better having someone there with you. I do not want to talk the entire time, but it would be nice to have company while strolling along and listening to music.Speaking of music. I have so many albums on backlog that I have not listened to yet. I want to listen to them, but I like listening to new albums the whole way through on the first go. So I save them until I am ""ready"" and ""have enough time to thoroughly enjoy them"", but that never happens even though a majority of my time is spend in my room doing nothing. I have not learned to drive yet. I have tried and I am scared. I feel like my anxiety is going to because me to over react and because an accident. it would be great to drive, then maybe I could go out and do things. But the thing is that not driving should not be holding me back this much. I do not need to drive where I live. Sure, it would make life easier, but there are plenty of busses or Ubers and even trains that I could take into the city if I wanted. But I do not. I go to work, I do some schoolwork, then I sleep and maybe I will eat if I am lucky while convincing myself that maybe next week things will change.My last semester of college is going be this fall and I feel like my entire world is crumbling because I do not know what I am going to do when it ends.I am overwhelmed, and I am bitter and irritable and angry and judgemental all of the time.

I get that - but being such a danger can they not transfer hospitals?I cannot be alone because everytime I am I self harm. All I think about is overdosing. I was weaned off lexapro 20mg in 12 days and started on venlafexine 75mg which hospital added another 37.5mg too which is only on about dag 8 of now. I know it is likely the med swap, I have got a long history of self harm and suicide attempts though and I am afraid. One side of my brain KNOWS I need to stay alive and I deserve to live and have a life but the other is screaming at me to just give up because even the health system could not deem me worthy of saving... I do not know what to do when I have already reached out to professionals, family, friends... all my history is looking up what meds to OD on and the amounts needed and the risk of failing or what damage they leave behind should I do fail.... how do I stop this it is so loud :( I am 27, swapping meds, and the suicidal thoughts are overbaring.",Suicidal
"I am eighteen and just recently had been kicked out of/moved out of my household with nowhere to go. I was at my highest point, hanging out with friends at six flags and enjoying my time. For the first time in a while, I was genuinely happy. It all vanished the moment my mothers boyfriend called to cuss me out/ mother refused to understand my pleas for respect. I know this seems minuscule, but imagine 18 years of a lack of empathy and emotional understanding. 18 years of your life without break. The toll it takes on a human? I have always been pushing back my suicide for another day, another year, for when life gets good. My biggest motivator in going on was the future. But that subtle reminder told me all I needed to know. I was set up for failure by those who were made to love me, the fact that I was never loved, done wrong multiple times, and there is no way of escaping it. No way of turning back the time. Even if I get rich, married, even live my dream life, Ill always be haunted by everything that is happened to me. Ill always be haunted by the fact that I have failed in some way...some aspect. I am fucked emotionally and while I forgive and love some of my family and the people in my life , I will never forget them for staring at a child in the face and deciding to allow what happened to them. To look at my blatant cries for help and turn a blind eye simply because it was not convenient for them. I do not want to wait for the good to happen because its always fleeting. Every time I am in a good place, wether it be 1 second or 1 year; Ill always have the eerie feeling that creeps up on me...reminding me that a traumatic and bad experience is just right around the corner waiting to strike. I cannot be happy without sadness wishing to steal the spotlight. Its hopeless and there is really nothing I can do about it. I do not want to live like this anymore. I do not want to grow old. I do not want to settle for a life of unhappiness just to prevent the temporary hurt of the few that care for me. Id rather bite the bullet and die now so I do not end up 45, wishing I had done it sooner, but being trapped because of those around me. I am young and relatively free so why not now? do not get me wrong, I love my close friends, my sisters, my father, maybe even my mother...but I think they will be okay with me being gone after the initial period of grief. I think my suicide would maybe even bring them closer/help them. I hope so. And if it does not then the blame is on me. I wish it was not this way, but it is.I am at a friend house currently and waiting to inevitably get dropped off at my mothers boyfriends house. When I am home Ill either turn around and run into oncoming traffic/jump off a high rise building. Or take a shitload of pills after getting yelled at for a final time so I can end up being one last inconvenience for my mother and her life. So those that traumatized me can watch me die and see the blood on their hands, and maybe finally Ill be heard. But that would be asking too much. I just want to die. I do not want to feel anymore. I will not have to feel anymore.To those reading and wishing to do the same. do not. Stay alive. Please have more care for yourself and do not end up like me. Take this as a cautionary tale. I love you all. Goodbye. Its Been Nice. I Love You All. Goodbye.",Suicidal
"I have had depression for a long time. Actually I have cyclothymia with predominant depression. My longest depressive episode lasted eight years, and it started when I was 19. I did not even know what being happy was supposed to feel like. I was doing okay until the pandemic. But working in the ED has killed me. I cannot do it anymore. The job I used to love is now so stressful. I am getting in trouble at work for my interactions with others but I am hanging on by a wire. I feel so hopeless and like I wish I was dead so I did not have to feel this way (I am not going to hurt myself, I just feel so bad I do not want to feel bad anymore, but I am safe). I have been talking to my therapist and psychiatrist and we are changing my medications. I just do not feel like anything will help. The only time I was happy I was on a great medication and I had to go off it because of a horrible rare side effect. I had no choice and cannot go back on it. And my husband and I want a baby but how can we when I am like this? He is so wonderful at least. I have spent almost my entire adult life - a good 15+ years - like this. I feel like I will never be happy and stable for a good long time. So what is the point? Things are just really bad right now",Depression

"I wanted to add something positive. I was depressed every day after high school till I was like 25 or 26. I could not make friends or get anywhere with women. I failed at pretty much everything. Eventually I came close to jumping off a five story ledge.Then I had a turnaround. A few days after the suicide attempt. I just got myself to realize I had a lot going for me. Most of my failures did not matter. Instead I needed to build on myself. Since then I have been very successful. Nothing is perfect. I would love to have some more success in relationships. But even when my relationship failed that did not set me back. I still worry a little about depression coming back but I stay busy trying to do everything I can go stay successful as that keeps me happy.I understand many of you are going through hell. There is a lot of issues with our country and world setting people back. I know not everyone can have success the way I did. I just hope a few of you manage to find your own path out of depression.

"Ill preface this by saying: I have seen numerous psychiatrists, therapists, G.P.s, and have been through the wringer with my family doctor throwing anti-depressant/anti-anxiolytic prescriptions at me to see what sticks. Everything still feels the same no matter what med, new routine, holistic solution, etc. I am exhausted of living. So, in March of 2020, I attempted suicide. I lived alone in a nice apartment; I locked the door to my suite, flipped the security latch, taped a handwritten DNR sign in my living room, locked the door, and I took an uncountable amount of Clobazam (not Clonazepam, different drug), 100 Gravol pills, and at least 50 nighttime Benadryl pills. I got into bed and listened to Strict Machine by Goldfrapp. Then, a feeling Id never felt before I was done. I felt like Id finished life. It was so soothing. It also could have been the effects of the massive quantity of pills I took. My then-girlfriend called me, and we have a fine conversation. This is where I black out. She tells me days after my failed suicide attempt what happened. I was completely coherent, and then just stopped talking. This is when I passed out. Long story short (too late), I wake up two days later in intensive care. Tube in my throat to regulate breathing. Catheter definitely in. Guess my DNR did not work. My parents (who live four hours away) are sitting around me as I come to. Fast forward, I convince everyone I am not crazy and they say maybe you should go to our psych ward and I said no, I will get better care when I move back to the city. (I was living in a small city at the time). I get back to my apartment. My parents stay with me. COVID breaks out. A post-grad program I am studying announces that classes are over. I move back to the big city in my parents basement. My degree is mailed to me. I keep having the same conversations with people. I keep doing the wrong things. I continue to comply with the Ministry of Transportation to get my drivers license back. They keep sending me different forms to get my doctor to sign. My depression/anxiety stays the same. Covid has made the world weird for years just days after my suicide attempt. Am in purgatory? So much violence, greed, and narcissism in the world like I have never seen before. Every day I work my jobs, but money just comes and goes if Id never even made anything. Same conversations, ad nauseam. Am in hell? Am I in Sartres No Exit? Most days, I think I am in purgatory.

"What can we say about the "" Unresponsive""? Do they leave us in the dirt because they have no answers? Do they leave us in the dirt because they are not capable of grasping what we are experiencing? Or are we turning their life upside down because we CHOOSE to explain to them what we are experiencing? Ghosting is the easiest thing to do when you want to avoid responsibility. So, what does that say about our counterparts.. the one's we vent to and supposedly trust but leave us in the dust.. What does that say about them.. they would rather experience ignorance than the truth. Our example leaves them render-less to what life is actually all about. it is easier to live your normal pathetic slave ridden life than it is to recognize that someone you care about is suffering and there is nothing they can do about it.. and that is why they ghost us.. not because they do not care.. but because they are inadequate, they are not the one's to solve our problems, we are.

"I am a college student who is currently doing a summer of research. One thing I learned from the very first moment I entered college is that my brain completely shuts down if someone is not kind to me. If someone slightly disrespects me, or talks to me in a condescending way, or even does not say you are welcome after I say thank you, I get extreme depression and anxiety, and my brain shuts down to the point where I cannot even add one and one. I had an incident with my PI about five days ago. He was working in the chemical hood when I asked him if I could come in at 5:00 PM the next day because I had plans. He asked if I knew what to do tomorrow, and I told him not exactly. He then proceeded to tell me to write a two-page protocol with all the calculations as well as every step of the experiment calculations. When I asked him how to do the calculations, his response was ""figure it out"" in a very condescending way. This was my first time ever asking him if I could come in late, so I do not know why he was mad at me. I wanted to come in late because I wanted to shadow a physician during the day. The entire night after my interaction with him, I could not decide on either to cancel my shadowing appointment, or just go there and let my PI pissed. I spent a couple of hours watching a video of him doing the experiment to his work and wrote a three page report. I then emailed him another question, and he did not reply the whole night. He usually replies very quickly, but he did not this time. I was extremely anxious and had no one to talk to about it, so I could not even get a good night's sleep. In the morning time, after waiting for my friend who lives in a different country to pick up the phone, I told her everything and she told me to go to the research. I texted the physician I was supposed to shadow briefly explaining why I could not come, and he was very understanding. So after showering and all, I went to my research, and at around 10:00 AM, my PI emailed me saying that he could not come to lab until evening time. He did this after I emailed him a couple of hours later that I cancelled my plan, and that I was going to come to lab. He said that something happened in his biostatistics class (yeah he is a graduate student), so he cannot come in until the evening. So now I am sitting in the office after I cancelled my shadowing experience and not doing any lab work. There were multiple times I was tearing up. I could not call my family because they live in a different country. I was really pissed the whole day, and after such a long day, he comes in with his flip flops at 6:30 PM and starts doing a 10 minute thing to his research. The amount of anger, frustration and sadness I felt was unbearable. Now I have been feeling depressed the whole week and I cannot even do any work because of it. I literally cannot get myself to get out of bed and submit one thing one click away. I did not get out of my dorm the whole weekend and did not shower up until a few hours ago. People because me so much pain. Many people are nice, but do not have good hearts, and that hurts me the most. I want to grow out of this without losing faith in humanity.

Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i breakLast time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels.

"I am the stereotypical ""hurr durr i hab big dreams"" guy. There are a hella lot of other people like me and I guarantee they will make it, but not me. I am a disgusting piece of shit. I am a mentally ill and diseased collection of atoms. I cannot even do a simple thing right and I am afraid of doing what I like because of the sheer insecurity I have. The biggest mistake I probably did was give out my real name and my ambitions like some sort of fuckin will, and then *living* the day after like nothing happened, being under support by a family with a rather severe case of stockholm syndrome and abusive behavier towards anyone that denies it.

"I wished for this. I literally took steps to get here. And all it makes me.... It makes me feel worse. Yeah my dates keep bailing on me, but people that once called me a best friend want nothing to do with me. Maybe I can reach out again, but chances are they will still ignore me. I literally brought this upon myself and it sucks. I mean, in high school, this is what I did. I boxed everyone out and only one person cared enough to stay. I thought I was happier then but no longer is it good for me. it is really just over. It really is. I burned those bridges and now I regret it but what am I going to do? I literally intentionally did it so it is not like it was not my fault. it is over with my friends. It sucks but it is. No more gaming groups no more talking about my problems no more helping others no more friends. I am no longer a priority and while I hate it it is my fault. And chances are, they do not care. And chances are, almost no one will care. I am not thinking about ending my life, and I am in therapy, but right now I am just working through trauma. This pain I am feeling feels endless and I only have a void inside to work with. I feel like I have lost all that I am. All that I was. Like I do not even stick to my motivation anymore. I definitely deserve this. When you make bad choices you have to live with the consequences. But it makes me feel empty. Like I am a horrible person. Like all my trauma weighs heavily. I cannot help but call myself terrible. I cannot help but insult myself. What am I supposed to do? Nothing. I do nothing. I leave all these people behind and I try again like I always have. I will be hurt for a while but eventually a new group will take me in only for me to abandon it. The times of happiness are getting shorter. From 4 years to 2 to less than a year and I already messed up. it is over man. Why try anymore. All I do is hurt people. I deserve no sympathy. I deserve no kindness. Someone who acts like me deserves nothing good. Can I even blame them for treating me like this? No. I wished for this and it came true. Jump onto the next train and hope and pray that maybe this next time I will stop sabotaging my own happiness. How am I supposed to care? Quick answer, I am not. No one can care about me. it is just over. Again, not ending my own life. Never will. Just living in a void and it is staring back. No smirk, no smile, no frown. Just nothing. I tried to box out my friends to avoid being cared about, and now they are ignoring me.",Depression

So let me first start by saying this I am grateful for what I have and I know that there are people that have less than me that have nothing and have already lost their lives. And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21-year-old black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know. If this is hard now why would I want to continue life so it can get harder I train physically to try and give myself something to focus on and now that is not even enough I am being ridiculed for being too muscular I cannot find a boyfriend because I am too intimidating and lonely I have no friends well none that are genuine anyway and that upsets me because I am a genuine person and they say the remedy to all of this is time but I do not want to wait any longer.

"When the pandemic started, I found myself without a job. Having also withdrawn from a practicum program which I was in to become a teacher (withdrew due to receiving abuse from a supervisor; I have no more passion for teaching kids), I started 2020 with the hope that I can find a better career, a full-time 9-5 office job hopefully. Pandemic turned this all around. I only have a part-time job and self-employment gig. A good thing is that the employer likes my work and gives me more hours and responsibilities, but I am unsure if my job field is suitable for me in terms of income and stability. I do not even know the full reality of this job (adult education), since we have not gone back to an in-person setting yet. After I find out more, I can decide to go back to school to get more credentials. I tell myself, ""let us wait until September when we go back in person"" and ""let us wait until I successfully finish this project next year so I can leave a good impression,"" but I am 25, and I just feel so behind. Just so behind because at this age, I have not even decided my career, have no full-time job, and most of all, still live with my family. I feel like an adult baby. Since the job is remote, I am stuck at home most of the time. It is so boring but most of all, it utterly feels suffocating to be at home because I am left with my ruminating thoughts filled with self-resentment. I feel so guilty every time when I do my hobbies. I tell myself, ""A loser like me cannot waste time away enjoying hobbies."" After getting vaccinated, I have been doing day trips to escape the dullness of my home and rumination. However, these day trips are just temporary escapes, and I am back to 0 when I come back home. I desperately want to move out (I can afford a room rent with my income), but I just feel so lifeless insideafraid to try anything new. This is different from how I was last year when I was extremely busy. I have no motivation to do anything. After I finish work, I just lay on my bed and use social media that makes me feel worse. I have no energy to go for a walk, let alone do self-improvement. I tried to do CBT on my own but had no energy to continue. I tried to look for a low-cost counsellor, but counselling did not do miracles for me, and I feel hopeless. I just want to escape, but there is no escape. I feel trapped inside. Any advice on coping with this somehow? I have no outlet to discuss this with anyone, so at least it feels good to write it down here. tl;dr - Stuck at home with self-resentment due to my bleak career options. Still living with my family. Feeling no motivation and just lifeless in general. I am stuck in limbo. I have no motivation and hope for the future",Depression

I know you love me and I love you too but that does not mean we have to like each other! Whenever we see each other well try to be friendly but other than that let us just avoid each other. he legit said that after I told him I feel like he does not try to help me mentally or try to understand how I feel and why I feel that way.

I was never sure why and still am not, but it is affected me all the same. I was born into a pretty poor family, my parents where under 20, mother was an artist and my father was a soldier. It was accidentally and they ended up splitting up due to the stress. My mum moved to a city in various houses, as she got into relationships with guys. Unfortunately my mum was poor, and had little help for taking care of me, so made a buisness so she could work from home to look after me. The partners she had where all very abusive To me and my mum. About this time school started for me. I had never played with other kids so just did not know how to act. The noise when I went in that classroom was fucking deafening. In my head I felt scared, and just starting crying. I could not control it. Was like that all my first year. Second year came and home life changed a bit but not for the better. My muk started to get very sick. She had very rare heart condition, schone's complex i think it is called. Causes her to have mini strokes and be very fatigued. Of course this kind of broke my mum a but, she was already pressured by all of it before the disease. I became her carer a little at home, getting her food and stuff. Not great but this year I made a friend, started playing with him all the time.

"I get these brief 5 seconds of motivation and hope, I can be like everyone else, stable and successful. Then my brain brings me back to reality, and reminds me of how I cannot. Every time I go to apply for jobs on Indeed or try to write down some sort of plan for the future, I just cannot do it. I physically feel nauseous thinking of having to be strong and try everyday. I want it all to end now. I do not want to build something for myself, I do not want to be successful. I just want to be air or a cloud. I do not like being human. Every time I have cared about someone, I lose them because I can become obsessive. My first crush landed me in the psych ward for 2 weeks because he did not like me back. that is what waiting for me whenever I catch feelings again. I cannot take this pain and I wish not to feel it.

I keep saying I am going to end up killing myself, I know my people love me and it will hit everyone like a train because they probably think I am great.

"TW mention of self-harm/ suicideMy depression has gotten really bad the past few weeks. Suicidal and self-harm thoughts are happening more often, and in general I just feel very gloomy and hopeless and anxious and awful. I am going through some pretty huge life changes right now as well, so I am really overwhelmed. I can feel myself slipping into a depressive episode, which has not happened in over a year. Old habits are starting to show up again, I am really scared of myself and scared of what might happen if I do not get help soon. I do not think I will act on my thoughts but still, I thought the same thing a year ago and I was wrong. Not asking for pity I just do not trust myself to take care of me, yk?A month ago I scheduled an appointment with my therapist, but her next available appointment is in another month, and I honesty do not know what will happen if I wait that long to get professional help. I am not saying I am going to kms but I am just scared for my well-being.I think staying at a mental hospital would really help me because I just want a break from all of the stressors in my life and I do not want to lay in my bed all day, which is unavoidable at this point. I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option. I do not know what else to do, but I really feel like I am a bomb waiting to blow up. What do you think I should do? I am just indecisive and bad at trusting my own judgement. Thanks Should I admit myself into a mental hospital?",Depression

I have just accidentally insulted my closest friend to the point she will not talk to me after she texted me during a slump and i snapped at her (yes, i apologised very sincerely). the guilt of upsetting her on top of the state i was already in has pushed me to tears for the first time in 2 years, and I am not sure how ill cope without being able to vent somewhere. idk if any of this is normal, and I am terrified that my mental state has deteriorated this badly recently.so thank you if you have read this, even if you do not respond. cried for the first time in 2 years",Depression

"I thought depression was something that could go away again, but now I am starting to realize that it probably never gets better actually - the best you can hope for is a zombie-state-life on medication where you cannot feel any euphoria from movies, music etc. When you get older you just lose your ability to feel profound emotions from stuff? I am only 22, but i feel like i have already experienced this decline since i was 14-15 when i started to feel really depressed. it is been 7-8 years now, and the only thing that made life worth living for me was smoking weed and being high 24/7, which you can only do for so long. Now I am back to being sober because weed was driving me completely insane and was having panic attacks everyday, and i feel completely depressed every single day wanting to kill myself. I cannot even get on medications because i accidentally told my doctor about my former weed habit, so they want me to be 6 months sober before prescribing any medication. I just wanted to ask in here, does it get better? is it a real thing, or is it just a myth.Otherwise I am ready to kill myself honestly, because I am not going to fight a losing battle any longer.

"I went out (further than my local store) for the first time in many years today. Ever before the pandemic I had not been out in a while due to depression and the increasingly massive weight gain it caused. For years i have been living and working in a small bedroom alone wearing the same pair of ripped leggins everyday. Recently I have been trying to diet and get out of my funk, and I thought I was ready to go out and enjoy the day! I made a special effort to dress properly and put on make-up etc. I knew I did not look GOOOD but I thought I was pretty innocuous, at least...but I could not even walk a few hundred metres without people making fun of me and mimicking my walk (waddle, I guess)It happened two separate times this morning and I have been crying ever since. Its pathetic....I thought I was getting better but today has just proved I am not, and likely will not without professional help which just is not coming. My mum (she is the one who came with me today, since I have no friends lol) called the mental health crisis team and my GP earlier today; both just kind of shrugged and said that thoughts and threats of suicide were not enough for them to intervene, I would have to try st first. Now my mum is frustrated because its 1AM and I am still sobbing! She said she is not going to spend time with me like this again because of my bad attitude which means I have absoloutely NOBODY Anyway I hope everyone else is doing better haha.

"Since April 16th, my top-floor apartment has been leaking (the roof needs repairs) so every time it is rained, it has rained in my home. Dirty, rusty, rain water filtered through the rooftop deck/external roof, onto the floors and countertops. I have maintained it with a bucket, a towel, mopping excessively. At one point during the heatwave in late June, the water dripping from the rooftop had found its way into the basement, landing on and corroding my unit's water heater. You want to be stressed out and unable to shower during a heatwave, all the while being billed for rent? Trust me, it blows. In just one spot alone, I have collected at least 2 gallons of dirty water. The rest landed onto the floor and therefore, into the unit below me. My whole living situation has really taken its toll on my mental health. Waking up in the middle of the night to a small noise, and then panicking that the ceiling's collapsed is awful. The last contractor in here said ""do not be afraid if it falls, its light weight material"" which just prepped me for it actually falling. Anyway, the city inspector is filing a report, and hopefully this will be fixed soon. But I feel vulnerable/unsafe from the wetness/leaking/potential-definite mold growth, terrified about further damage, and so, if days/weeks/months from now, and I am not here----- hell, I know who is to blame.

"So I met this girl on tinder 1 1/2 years . We became friends with benefits because as an attractive man I run into a lot of women who only likes me for my looks but breaks up with me because my depression is so bad. And to mention between us two I was the more attractive one and she leaned more towards average. I was 22 when we met and she was 18. I enjoyed her intelligence and could look past the obvious difference in attractiveness. She took the time to understand my mental health and stuck by me through my issues. I also help her with her family issues because her father was emotionally abusive and her mother is classified as psychotic but refuses help. As time went on we became increasingly involved with each other romantically and sexually which we both always consented to. My mother kicked me out so I wanted to get an apartment and she offered to be my roommate because she could not handle her father any longer. We finally got the apartment and it was like a dream come true we were always happy and barely argued and had more sex than we could even imagine. We adopted a kitten and I worked over night at Lowes as mst so I could barely stay awake to take care of the chores. And when I would be awake I would finally relax and play the Xbox for a little. She did not have a job and was paying rent with unemployment checks. Once unemployment ended I had to take care of the bills untill she could find a job 2 months later. I helped her start a tarot business and that brought in no where close to the amount required for rent. Though I still supported her even after also paying late fees. So when it comes to my depression and suicidal thoughts its random and the only way Id cope is by making music , gaming and smoking weed. Her grandpa caused me to lose my job because he would always drop me off late even though I was paying him . So I was coping with this failure with my usually vices while she finally was hired . But I did not get the same support I displayed for her when she did not have a job . Music was paying the rent until my song was stolen by bk the rula. So I was in the deepest void that I have ever been in because this apartment was my first attempt at independence. She usually took acid at least 3 times a month for meditative reasons and suggested that I should try it because someone said it helps with depression and self realization. I was skeptical so I did not take it until 2 months later. She planned on taking it at the same time so I finally consumed it. The problem is she did not take hers and went to bed. I did not know this and began feeling the effects. At first it was pleasant and gave me this feeling of joy and an unwavering arousal. But then things took a really bad turn . I owned color changing led lights and the walls felt like they were closing in on me. All i could think about was killing myself; nothing felt real thus convincing me that if I died nothing would matter or be concrete. I started punching myself and trying to rip out my hair. Then for some reason the flashing light got faster and increasingly vivid. I felt as if I was falling into my mattress while dying 1000 different ways in my mind but my thoughts felt like reality. Nothing existed but my sad scarred soul. I finally convinced my broken mind to get up and ask her for help . I was gripping the sheets trying to find something that felt real or I would have surely slit my own throat. Of course the feeling of arousal never left because that was the first reaction I received after consuming the substance. So her being the only woman I was intimate with I always felt comfort in her breasts and she has always consented prior to this incident. So for sum reason while under the influence I felt that her Boob was the most concrete thing in my reality so I held it while being the big spoon. She instantly told me to back off so I got up and left immediately feeling shame loneliness. I felt meaningless and was convinced that I was truly alone and should not exist. I lost my mind in my room until I passed out. The next morning I was finally coming down and was beyond traumatized. I spoke to her and explained what happened but all she could focus on is how she was traumatized from me holding her boob. I reminded her that we shared a bed every other day and that cuddling like that is a normal occurrence because we loved each other and pretty much was dating without a label. She finally seen it from my side and understood how scary it might have been for me. She held me and told me she was sorry and that she should have noticed what was going on.she offered to have sex to make me feel better but I declined because I am not into sexual pity. Also my depression has extremely increased since I have took the acid. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. She just abandoned the apartment and left me with the cat and half of my property was locked in her room. She did not come back until the last day and told everyone in my family and her friends that I sexually assaulted her. I was hurt and confused because I was left with a kitten and was losing my apartment that I worked so hard for. I paid for everything in there all she owned was a few things in her room. And to say I sexually assaulted her is a defamation to my image and character because I have never forced myself upon her .so I was angry , heart broken and betrayed so I attempted suicided by slicing down my wrist with a razor and the razor was pretty much half way lodged into my wrist . My mom found me before I could bleed out and rushed me to the er. When I got back home I got into the locked room grabbed all my things and sum evidence (her diary that she started when we first moved in) and left with my kitten. Till this day she will not talk to me and is telling people I sexually assaulted her . Am I in the wrong ? The experience in that room full of lights still replays in my head and haunts me to this day . My friend who was once raped twice in the Dominican Republic says that this situation does not count as sexual . Can anyone give me advice on how to cope or what should I say to her or if I should take legal action? This would have never happened if I did not believe her and took the acid as a cure for depression. I was stupid for being so nave but therapy does not work and I am not up to taking any man made medications anymore . I just wanted to feel normal for once but I ended up feeling worse than when i started.Sorry for any misspelling and grammatical errors. My fwb/roommate betrayed me and claims I sexually assaulted her but I do not think I did, and I still love her. This caused me to lose my first apartment.help!",Suicidal

I am not quite sure how to describe it, I guess it is just one of those things you know, like when you are in love, when you are hungry or just need the loo.

I have been wrongfully accused of a crime that I never committed, which took the system a year of intimidation, court rooms and sever depression and anxiety to determine that she had made it all up. I have been a victim of extortion, blackmail and cybercrimes, involving intimidation, fear and had no one to talk to. I am the eldest of three, and the eldest of my family's generation and link that keeps my stressed-out family together. I have felt the feeling of loving another, but never the feeling of it being mutual. I was once a happy child in a happy house with a dream of changing the world, and the aptitude to do it.

Some of the teachers probably hate me because of the way I behave. At least in school I have some close friends.I have attempted suicide multiple times and all of them fails. Probably because of I actually do not want to die. I just want to have a normal lifestyle and be happy like others. I just want to not have this thoughts out ifnmy head. Even if I am happy a bit, this thoughts eventually come back.I am only 16 years old now. I did reach some help but none was successful. I told the teachers that I trust at school.

Perhaps I just want someone to notice. Someone to acknowledge the fact I am suffering. I feel so unseen. All of my suicide attempts I failed on purpose because I desperately wanted someone to see that I really was doing badly and just wanted to be loved and cared for. I am in a position where I cannot seek mental help, and I know that I am awful for doing this. I am just so desperate for someone to care and check up on me. But as time goes on, I am tempted to do it for real. The only thing stopping me is my boyfriend and my grandmother. I have already hurt them enough. And I am afraid of failing.

Prison-like conditions, groups only 2 hours a day, a psych that sees you 5-10 mins in the morning, 0 sleep, no counselors, no social workers. They did not give me my Xanax and I had 2 seizures, lost my voice, control of my face and thought I was going to die.

I do not really date anymore, for me to be close enough with someone and like them enough to have sex with them is rare since moving back home. I also still live with my extremely obsessive parents in a pretty remote area which makes meeting new people super difficult. All of this leaves me feeling so isolated and behind from everyone, and I am terrified to make any change in my life that could somehow fuck me up worse than where I currently am.

I know that venlafaxine has more noradrenergic effects at higher dosages and was wondering what that usually translates to in terms of how it makes you feel?

"I know the knee-jerk reaction is to call cops on people.To my utter detriment, I am 100% sane. There is scarcely any reason or legal grounds to hospitalise me against my will, save for the fact I have been (rightfully, and logically) suicidal for the past 13 or so years.All the cops do is offer disgustingly hollow platitudes, and then leave. Same for suicide hotlines, or therapists, or psych wards. Hot take, but therapy and medication do jack shit when your issues stem from mostly material conditions such as oppression, poverty, loneliness, and long-term (often systemic) abuse.Whenever I have a BPD meltdown - and that is very often - a lot of people opt to either ignore it, or call the authorities. Due to my background of abuse and lapses in memory, I will not trust a one-time ""it will be fine, you can talk to me!"". Alleged friends no longer commit to anything they promise or say in the heat of the suicidal crises. And I realise it is not an obligation. But I willingly subject myself to horrible shit to keep up to date with suicidal people again and again and again, never resting assured I miraculously saved them.Comfort takes time. it is a lost art. Love takes time. As does trust, and henceforth, anything meaningful. I say I do not have friends, having 400+ ""friends"" on FB, as it would be saying you have nutrition if you ate McD for every single meal ever. Comfort takes time. But dialling 112 and never saying a word is easy.What am I venting for then? A lament for the unlovable? Ode to the abandoned? Perhaps simply a reminder to take a long hard look at your real friendships. Check in with people. Pick out the ones you want to commit to, and go balls to the wall, because frankly, some people like me can be saved, but only with a lot of effort.Show up. We might object. Help up do the dishes. Bring groceries when you come. Organise things with solid dates and times. Be stern and uncompromising, but touch us with love when you go in for that awkward hug.There will be obstacles. I do not trust a soul in a 500 km radius, and then there is people I have unrequited feelings for, and then there is America. Distance is a bitch, but you will probably either drink or gamble that money anyway. Gods, please, just show up. I would have paid, for every single trip, I would have paid.But there was no comfort.

If this is not allowed then please remove.I am wondering why I have met so many people who have survived multiple overdoses.Is it the case that people just wake up or is it the case that medical intervention will save someone from an overdose most of the time?I am not planning to OD I guess I have a somewhat morbid curiosity about why that method is so unlikely to work. Why do so many people survive overdoses?,Suicidal

"I am a (M35) who have been struggling with depression more or less my whole life.What I can remember, is that from the age of 9, I have been an extreme introvert that attempted suicide at many occasions but with the luck or bad luck based on how you look at it never succeeded.For many years I would not talk with people and had a temper that made people frightened and made some enjoy pushing my buttons until I snapped.Disappeared whole school-days and just sat at isolated places considering my options even trying to end it.First time was in a forested area outside my school age 9.Had a rope and decided ""it is time"".Trew it over a large branch and anchored it to another tree. Picked up some rocks to make a makeshift stool that I could stand on.Lost conciousness and woke up 10-15 minutes later with a bleeding wound above my eyebrow and an extrem headache, sore throat and a redness around my neck. The large branch had broken of and hit me in the head and my face got smashed against the rock I was standing on.Went back to school and said that I tripped and there was no need for a check-up.This is my strongest memory from my childhood and many year later it is still something that makes me sad, because no one cared where I was for 1,5 hour age 9.My parents never got told and I will never tell them because it even today would hurt them, my brother knows about that and some other tes as well.I struggled through school at all levels and never connected with anyone because I (according to myself) was ugly, stupid, uninteresting, mean, angry and a horrible person and I made myself that person for years knowing fully aware that I actually was loving, caring, thoughtful, kind and interested in other people's problems.Even after that I would not even try to make connections with other people feeling less than everybody else, still playing the role as the cocky self-important asshole I have made myself up to be.At age 28 i meet a wonderful woman that never gave up on learning to know the real me.She more or less forced herself onto me and I did not stop it because I actually wanted her to break down the wall I have for years built up around myself.She is the most important person in my life but I have had my down periods where I just cannot allow her to see me weak and the latest one I had was today.I am away from my family more or less 5-7 days a week and it hurts but I do it for them so we can afford to still live as we do.But today was painful, I told my oldest son ""dad is going to work"" and he just said ""Bye"" with me kneeling to get a hug and no hug was given.My youngest just waved and then continued with what he was doing and I was totally heartbroken.Walked out to my car with my wife after me and just started to cry feeling like a stranger that just visits the boys mom from time to time.did not allow my wife to touch me became cold towards her.Hated my job, hated life, hated my own existence a d just want my wife to divorce me so that she could be happy and the boys could have someone that is always present for them and not se stranger who comes to visit a day or to each week.As a person that only have my parent, brother and my own family in my circle of life it is hard to find any reason why I should not just fade away from my boys existence even though it selfish and hurtful not just to the boys and my wife but probably the end for me.This sucked and was totally stupid to write.Publish it but will be removed in another 30 minutes or sooner.

"Story of my life, right? My life is on such a downward spiral and it is all my fault. I cannot handle real life responsibilities and so I just gave up on life. I have no motivation or willpower.

I wake up everyday and I go to the same old shitty part time minimum wage job. Everytime I try to crawl out of this pit of depression, I just fall right back down. I tried improving myself with school to try and get out of my shit job, but I cannot even study without being distracted and so now I am 3 weeks overdue on my homework with no desire to do homework anytime soon. I feel so guilty about it, but I cannot bring myself to sit down and learn. I am severely in debt because I am an impulse shopper, and I have never been in a relationship in the 24 years I have been alive on this shit hole, so I have no one to even share how I feel (not even family cares or understands what I am feeling either). I feel so trapped in my eternal depression cycle. There are so many things in my life that make me want to end my life, but the only thing that is keeping me here is my survival instinct.

"I feel like I have been on the edge for several weeks now. Stress at work has been mounting up, and unfortunately my brain is wired so that if I do one thing wrong, then that must mean I cannot do anything right. I always thought its weird that I can look at those thoughts and realize they are false, but I cannot ever shake them. The lack of any friends or support group just means I have been internalizing and ruminating on all my negative emotions again, and for the past few weeks I have felt like I could break out in tears at any second. The loneliness I have in life is near crippling, but I do not want to complain any more about it on this board than I already have.Anyways, today I started playing an old game that I used to watch my parents play as a little kid (Tomb Raider II if anyone is curious) just for the nostalgia value, and something about it just hit me really hard. Just all these feelings came flooding back, memories of pure contentment and not having to worry about anything. Being surrounded by people that love me, and not having to be concerned about going to work tomorrow, or paying bills, or trying to save more money. I realized today that those days and feelings are gone, and they will not be coming back. I guess realizing that was my tipping point, because I have been crying off and on all day now. I am just so exhausted. I want to give up so badly but it would devastate my parents if I was gone. Can someone please just tell me things will be okay?

"So I am moving to a different apartment next week, and to be honest, even though moving is a serious pain, it has been one of the best things to happen to me.I have made a decision to get rid of most of the stuff I have, I have basically thrown away 80-90% of the stuff in my current apartment and kept only the basic 10% of stuff that I need. Over the last two weeks, I have spent a lot of time just cleaning up my current apartment and throwing out stuff that I do not need or donating it if it is in good condition. The decluttering has lightened my mind so much. it is like someone has just lifted a huge weight off my head.I have lived here for the last 6 years, 4 of which I have spent in depression and honestly, I cannot wait to get out of this apartment in a couple of days (I move on Wednesday). I am feeling proud of myself for taking and executing this decision to move out (even though I did not need to, as everything was just fine with this apartment otherwise). It really is a much needed change that I am looking forward to. I hope the new apartment brings better luck and better mental health in my life.

"Throwaway account because my partner follows my main account and it might be compromised too, for reasons I will explain soon.I am 33 and currently in living as an immigrant in a EU country, not my own (I hail from another continent), since 4 years or so with my fianc.I have health issues, both mental and physical, that prevent me from working since about 2 years ago (CPTSD, Clinical depression, burnout, chronic pain due to severe injuries I received), I do not really speak the language here that well, partly because it took me over a year to become ""fluent"" and then because covid happened and I went months without seeing other human other than cashiers at the market or my partner) so I lost a lot of proficiency.I am not saying he is a bad person or that he is isolating me, because he is been doing his best to take care of me. it is just... I have lost so much freedom here, I am unhappy and no one really takes my need for help seriously.I am not in contact with my family anymore because one of my parents is very dangerous, controlling and abused me since my childhood. Like most abusers this parent projects a great public persona and divided the rest of the family in a ""either you support my side or are against me"" so most of my family cut contact with me to prevent drama with my parent. This person has tried to stalk me and threaten me if I speak up on their abuse, to the point of finding people I worked with years ago and using them as messengers.As you might guess I became overprotective of my privacy, I functionally do not have much of a social media presence anymore, take pictures or even talk to former friends much. I also do not have friends here either.I know my parent has stalked and found most of my social media accounts and tried to find my addresses when I move to another place (no idea how they manage to do that but they have even found my landlord info twice in 6 years despite being in another country). Imagine how bad this person is that I moved continents just to get away from them.I have been trying to get therapy here, but my partner thinks it is unnecessary and an unneeded expense. I cannot get treatment for my chronic pain for the same reasons, I cannot even speak of pain killers without being treated like an addict in our house.I probably fucked up coming here and I probably should have never done so I do not have anyone, I do not have friends, or family or anyone that can help me, I have no place to call home or to return to, I just feel so alone and trapped and isolated and I miss human contact so much I do not remember the last time I spoke with another human that was not a cashier.

"I have wanted to share my problems since forever but never was brave enough. After scrolling reddit for so long, I decided I will share my story with you. This is quite long, and I want to cover everything...So, my mental problems started when I was 7 years old. In my life I never had a close friend or a family member (mostly because I am the oldest) who I can talk to or even spend time with. I was distanced in a village, far away from the town I was going to school. So my loneliness started in my early age.Whenever I was alone I would overthink: what is the point of this, why do we live, what happens after death, and so on... That made me really paranoid and serious person.it is good to say that my parents were always good to me and I never had a problem with them. We were not poor nor rich, we were just an average family.I will skip my primary school because in there nothing really happened.When I started going in high school, I distanced from people way more. I was spending most of my time sitting in front of my computer, alone. At some point I started getting scared of people and interactions with them. Alongside with social anxiety I started overthinking even more. That part of my life was the worst, it was rainy for almost 2 weeks and I was getting depressed more and more. Also in that period my cat died which led me to suicidal thoughts. Time passes and I was in the same condition.After some time my parents asked me why do I not go out with someone or at least go outside. I would always tell them that I am feeling good here alone and that I do not want to change anything (which is true, I really do not). Time passes and they were getting more concerned about me and my mental state. Out of nowhere, my dad told me he called a psychologist. I was very angry about that, but I did not have a choice. After 2 arrivals psychologist told me I am completely fine and that I just need to get a friend.Now this part of story gets really weird even for me, because I do not know what I was thinking at that time.So out of nowhere I just started to get emotional over anything. For example, getting ridiculed (idk if this is the word) on really hurt me, which never happened before. After a long speech with my parents, I told them that I do not want them to decide my life and leave me alone. They accepted that.After this long period I started having headaches, was eating not even 2 meals daily, and could not sleep. This is still going on and it is getting worse.

"Hello, my best friend is a 28 (F). she is been struggling with depression for some years now, she is medicated and such. She had a suicide attempt around 2017 after a very bad burnout episode (her career is highly demanding). she is been with this boyfriend for 10 years. They broke up for 2 months around 2017, a little before her suicide attempt, then they resumed their relationship. He broke up with her yesterday and she tried to take her life. She called me crying and sobbing loudly from the hospital yesterday. She told me that she told him he did not want to be with her anymore. She basically crumbled. Her mom called me today and told me that she tried to take her life but they found her in time. I really dislike the boyfriend, if I am honest, I have never been a fan of him. Hes always seemed off to me, distant. But as her friend I always made the effort to support her decision to be with him. Right now she is still hospitalized and crying inconsolably. Her psychiatrist is traveling to where she is (she is out of town, about 18 hours driving away). I feel really sad that i cannot be there for her and her mom. I do not know how to continue to support her. I want to be there 100%. I have never been depressed so I do not know how to approach it. I have been crying because I am really scared that we will lose her. Can someone please tell me what can i do or say to help? Any tips are appreciated.

"I like to think of myself as a good person but it just hit me that I think I am becoming an awful human being. I am pushing the people away that care about me the most and I am willingly leaving myself with nothing. I have gone through so many friends, some good and some bad, but every time things seem to be going good in the friendship, I stop responding to them.I just finished pushing away the closest group of friends I have ever had.

"I have a job that I hate, almost graduated with a degree that I will not even be able to use because my partner wants to live somewhere it is useless. And now my partner said the thought of touching me makes her physically ill (I asked for a hug because I have been sad lately). All of my friends are either ""friends"" or have just left. I am always there for anyone who needs me but now I need someone and I am by myself. Everyone is just too busy for me. I hurt myself superficially and I know my partner is going to be furious with me If she sees if/when she comes back to the house tonight. My family disowned me years ago and the only person who speaks to me now is my abusive mother. All I have got in the world to live for is my cat, who probably only has a year or so to live anyway (he is old and his heart is failing him). I keep trying to tell myself that I have to keep going for something but I cannot think of anything I want to do that I could ever do, or anyone who would miss me, genuinely not just for attention on social media (mother). I know my partner would take care of my cat, he really likes her and probably would not even notice I was gone. I just cannot think of any good reasons to keep fighting, I have tried so hard for so long and I think I have finally run out of steam. I love this world and I love many people in it,but they would all be better off without me, if they even noticed I was gone. Thanks for listening. Why bother?",Suicidal

"I have never lived a year of my life without getting this feeling multiple times. i feel so disgusted by people looking at me, thinking about me, talking about me, thinking they know me and having ideas about me when they know absolutely nothing. i hate the fact other people can see me. i feel so embarrassed and disgusted by everything about myself. its literally humiliating when someone takes pictures of me or has a conversation about me. i hate the moments when i show any emotion in front of someone else and i hate that i am pressured to do so. smiling, hugging, speaking, doing anything that is seen as things you are supposed to do makes me feel like i am degrading myself.i do not know wtf this feeling is. it comes up often and i do not know how to call it other than i completely hate everything about myself i hate being a human i hate my body and my voice and my personality. i have things i like about myself and they are all trapped in my head where no one even knows they exist, so everything that is pure and not horrible about me is something nobody knows about. i try so hard to look and act the way that is good and clean and represents who i am and i always fail. i can put hours into working on my hair and clothes and they will look dirty and like i put no effort in.there is just something about me that is so horrible and carries this awful vibe of rotting filth. its like i was cursed from the very moment i was born. i need to make money so i can get plastic surgery and then move away from everyone I have ever known and start a new life hopefully having escaped being this filthy creature. i need to change everything to get rid of this feeling. it hurts so fucking much i do not understand why i feel this way and I am so angry that i have to deal with this and no one gets it i want a moment of peace idk if this is normal in depression. i come out of every social moment feeling like I have sinned against myself",Depression

"I have not made new friends in years. Even after being in summer camps for the last 4 weeks, I just end up alone and uncomfortable, left out and painfully obviously alone and out of place. Because I cannot displace my thoughts with media feeds, I am left to my stream of thoughts on how unbelievably lonely, wimpy, and drab my life is going to be, how incredibly degraded living conditions on Earth are for inconceivable volumes of people, how I am slowly and exclusively failing each of my opportunities one by one, how I enjoy practically nothing, how overwhelmingly pointless ""fighting through it"" is, and perhaps most of all, how badly i hate me for all of the aforementioned and more. I struggle to go through a full hour without concluding that I should and wholly wanting to be dead.So I figure it is probably high time to get some help before I seriously start drawing up plans, at least for my family's sake. I have done research on methods and effectiveness so I probably would not get a second chance if I really went for it. Only problem is I have no idea how to go about getting help. I am told that if I am to go to therapy, I will have to actively work towards bettering myself. that is going to be a problem, considering that at this stage I just want to die, not be convinced to complacently stick around around and pay bills and taxes for another 60 years. Do I need a will to live to benefit from therapy? Is it worth a shot to go? Is my only option to get prescribed anti depressants? Or does my stubbornness render my only choice being choosing one way or another? Simply put, how do I get help? How should I get help?",Suicidal

"For such a long time I have lived in that small space of my basement appartement. It was one small room and a even smaller bathroom.The last 5 years of these 19 were the worst. I had night terrors about beeing burried alife. The appartement made me feel weird after some time and my life got to the bad side once I started living in the basement. I had no more drive doing anything, there was no energy or believe in myself. Just watching the internet. I barely had 2 friends that i saw maybe once or twice a month.But after one night terror where i dreamed I was stuck in my appartement for the rest of my life (I literally saw the windows dissapear and a stone wall behind them) I jumped out of bed and ran out of the door and stood naked in the staircase with my heart racing. I slowly realised it was a dream but there i stood there naked and thankfully no one saw me. So i just went back to bed. But the night terrors kept on comming. After a while i seemed to loose the skill of keeping track of the night terrors.I just barely woke up letting out a loud scream every night for a few month and went back to bed sometimes without realising what happened the next morning. But truth is no one could hear me screem down there in that ""hole"".This made me realise that I am in a prison and need to get out. I need to change something. I did therapy and after such a long time of having no job just sitting in front of my screen all day in the basement i finally found a job. And the appartement that i now live is on the top floor.What is so weird now i can finally see the world! I never saw humans in my basement appartement and now i can see people walk on the street! I can see the rain falling! I can see people sit together talking with each other. I was so isolated for such a long time i thought it is normal to be alone and just browing the web.I think now that I am 36 years old, i want to make more of my life now after so many years spent in isolation. I want to move now maybe ever 5 years to see more of the world. I have a huge list of things i want to do now and i hope i can.You guys would not believe how fucking bright this appartement is where i life now. I have a nice balcony this is such a great thing to have. And the appartement i am now in has huge glass walls behind the balcony so every morning the sun is shining into the whole appartement. I must say the first mornings i thought to myself ""wtf its 5 am why is the sun soo bright??"" because in my basement appartement i never really saw the sun.I do not want to say basement appartements are bad but its the time spend below earth that can drive you crazy. Or me at least. Anyway I am so relieved that I made it. After 19 years living in a small basmement appartement i finally found a job and was able to move up!",Depression

"Last night I had nightmares about my girlfriend cheating on me. This is the first time this has ever happened. we are in a loving relationship and the sex is great. she is honestly the best thing in my life. The only ray of light in my hell hole of a life. I guess my subconscious thinks I should question even her because nothing In my life has ever worked out.Its no exaggeration to say that our house looks as bad as the house in fight club. The chimney has cracks going all up the sides. the bathroom is covered in mold that comes back every time you bleach the surfaces. The cabinets in the kitchen are dyed with a thick layer of tobacco tar; if we boil water, the condensation drips down the doors and leaves streaks. We scrubbed them for a whole day but it only got some of it. The carpet is stained yellow from my aunt's cat living alone in there for a few months after she died and my cousin would not come get her. Before moving in we rug doctored it and although the water was black when we were done, it is still a smelly disgusting living room. There is no insulation, in fact in some parts of the wall near the doors and windows you can see to the outside. Our power bill is about 270 dollars a month thanks to that. For the last two years I have been living in squaller because my parents found it convenient. My grandmother lives next door you see. And she has congestive heart failure. So it is best to have someone there. I love my grandmother so I do not mind but it does become a lot sometimes. More than I can balance with a job. My commute is an hour and the pay is garbage but I was just fired from my other job where I was a manager. I was manager for a month before a disgruntled employee who did not get that position threatened to sue the company for racism since I am white and she was black. My boss told me not to worry about it and then a week later ""offered an opportunity"" for me to step down. When I refused, I got the axe. To make matters worse I cannot trust my family to help me. In fact I hate them. My father beat the shit out of me when I was a kid, he even used a 2x4 on me once. My mom used that to manipulate me to do whatever she wanted because ""she was on my side"" and when I broke that off it became if I say no it means I am a bad person. Because she would only ask for things that SEEMED like they were in the best interest of others but just by coincidence she got exactly what she wanted out of the deal too.I have had conversations with them both before but they just do not register what the problem is. I can spell it out for them but nothing ever changes. I am 26 years old and my parents still control everything and every time I try to shake them, they use their financial leverage to shackle me back up. Every time I get a job that pays well to start saving up, I get dozens of calls a day about how my grandmother needs this or that or my sister's need something all of a sudden or she will call something on one of my accounts and if I do not do this very time consuming task I will lose my money or some shit like that. But then if I do not have a job, I get the same treatment trying to force some shitty 10 dollar an hour bullshit retail job on me. And that is where I am at. If this is all life has to offer, I do not want any part of it anymore. My life is not worth living.",Depression

"I am not really sure what I am expecting from this, but it probably cannot do any harm.I (18M) have been depressed for a little under a year now and feeling suicidal on and off for most of that time. Recently, things have worsened and I have started cutting myself and I feel like I am on the edge of just killing myself. I have not really got much to feel depressed about on the surface, I live in a wealthy part of the UK, I have got a decent family and I was lucky to go to a good enough school and have opportunities. But that does not change how I feel, which is hopeless and pretty neglected. I have always been the quiet, reserved one and I have not minded that so much, I have always been fine with my own company, especially since I was bullied mercilessly as a child. People who know me well get more humour and jolliness than strangers, but almost nobody knows anything actually personal about me. Since I have always lived fairly far from town, I never really had the same friendships as everyone else, or the freedom to go out and make them, even in my teenage years. It has left me feeling lonely, especially since many friends over the years have simply abandoned me. Simply put, I never seem like anyone's first choice, my parents have always focused on my brothers more than me and my friends are not really there for me at all; they never have been. Not one of them has asked if I have been OK in the last year, despite my still spending time in groups with them. I have tried asking for help or support, but I never know how to say it. I have always been very good at hiding my own feelings and problems and been the one who listens, who solves other people's problems. ""Hey I am depressed and want to off myself, got any tips?"" is not the best conversation opener I have ever heard. I knew a friend who described the looks he got when his depression became evident to his friends - ""like a wounded animal"". He described how he felt everyone was permanently walking on eggshells around him. I do not want that for myself, especially not since I know that my parents would never let me out of their sight knowing I was suicidal.My boyfriend, well, where to start. I genuinely thought he was the one, stupid at my age as that sounds, I know. Everything had going so well, but I wonder if our relationship has stopped being healthy recently. He sometimes becomes argumentative and angry when we are texting about things, and criticises things about me, my life and my family. Some of it is quite fair, but the sheer hate and rage bordering on contempt I feel from him when he does this hurts me a lot. Most of the time he is sweet and funny and never angry in person, but the angry episodes online have become more frequent. I have tried standing up a little more for myself (which I find very difficult in general) or asking for him to be kinder with me, but nothing really changes. I am beginning to wonder if he is emotionally abusive or not, but it is hard for me to tell anything about anything at the moment while I have a lens of depression over everything I think. Resisting the cognitive distortion that he hates me like everyone else is already using a lot of my energy.To be honest, I could go on all night giving tired rants about this that and the other that is gone wrong in my life or that I hate about myself, but I will not bore you with all that. Suffice it to say, I have got no hope left and I am tired of going through the effort of living everyday. I hate that my reaction to anything bad happening now is the urge to cut myself, and I have been wishing for death every day for some time now. If everyone knew how much I was hurting they would probably treat me better but that is not really the point, is it.I have decided I will kill myself in 4 days, but I do not know how yet. I fear death, but I do not want to live any more.Thank you for reading if you got this far, I am sorry I wrote so much - it just sort of happened. I have had enough",Suicidal

But its funny, its still there. I bump my hip in to the side of the counter- why do not you kill yourself you stupid bitch. Not every time. But a fair amount. I guess I just do not really get to talk about the weird change because the people I am around have not experienced it in the same way I have. But yeah. Its just a strange existence. Sorry.

"I do not want to go into a lot of detail, I was wondering if maybe some of you know this feeling. Since I was a kid there was a string of deaths in my family and I have always had long periods of numbess or detachment, questioning reality sometimes at night, etc. I have had a death in my family recently and it is been worse than ever. People seem fake/empty and boring, causing me to avoid social activities even more. The worst is when I force myself to hang out with ""normal people"" talking/complaining about trivial things, I just want to get up and leave. Nothing brings joy or excitement because it feels ""off"".Death and the passing of time freak me out horribly and I begin to doubt anything even exists, maybe even my ""self"" is an artefact of some sort. I do not know what I like or who I am, I kind of stole personality traits and interests from other people, nothing feels real. Everything just freaks me out so badly that I kind of disconnect I guess. In a way I am grateful for the numbness as I fear ""waking up"".

"You ever get that feeling of either complete numbness to the pain you have gotten used to or totally anxious to a lot of things that you should be doing in your life to turn it around and you know what and how to exactly do it but something just holds you back for whatever reason..Thus we are stuck with the daily routine of watching days pass by waiting for that one free time of the day (if you are working or at school) to just lose yourself and forget about troubles by doing a hobby i.e. netflix, videogames etc.. and then you wake up and rinse and repeat..

"Its been so long. So many years wasted laying in my bed avoiding everything. Because I do not belong in this world. If Id actually done something about it when I was younger it might have worked out better. But I got pushed to the back when my siblings needed special care for their needs. I pushed it all to the back of my mind so I would not be a burden if I asked for help. Ill do it later was always the way I looked at it. Deal with the feelings later. But now its a decade later and I still feel like I have not done anything to fix it. I have tried therapy, pills, mindfulness, all of the bullshit they tell you will help. Pills gave me worse feelings, therapy felt belittling and like I was just an issue they wanted out of the office, mindfulness does not work. My own psychiatrist does not even help. He pushes pills endlessly or tells me well stick to Zoloft for now, it seems to be working I am on half the dose I was on before, he even said abilify was not needed anymore. It is not working, doctor. I am tired of pills, therapists, appointments. I want it to stop. I have even started thinking about ECT. Just zap it back to normal. If its unfixable, just tell me already. Just tell me there is no fucking hope and let me leave. Stop giving me these false hopes. Its too hard to cope with. I am so angry with it all.

"I have been in a relationship for 9 years with a woman I thought I was going to marry, nine years later I feel as she is the reason I feel like I want to end my life. over nine years we have been on and off mostly on but we have broken up 4 times in those years. Always because I could not deal with her undiagnosed bipolar. She had finally got diagnosed four years ago but refuses to take meds but last year she got pregnant with our second child her third. After she gave birth she decided she was going to take meds for her anxiety bc it could be a stresser to her bipolar issue did so for three months then she fell pregnant again with our third her fourth child and has been told to get off her meds. So for the past 13 weeks she had been off her meds and it has been extremely hard due to her bringing up things that have happened in our relationship over the years but she always brings them back up and last year when she was pregnant I screwed up more then I ever have and was talking to another woman thousands of miles away sexually. But have since realized I was wrong and I really do love this woman but for the past few months it has been very hard to not give in to my depression.

People see someone on tv or wherever doing it and recognize that these kind of actions/tropes communicateIm desperate/I need help and then replicate them to communicate this message to their environment.

"Hi all,I write this just because I need to let it out. Its a description of my current situation without the full story or details, otherwise it would be a very long post. Thanks to whoever will have the patience to read it.My family situation has always been precarious and I had little to none margin of error, but I have got everything wrong nonetheless. I am a 30 years old guy and I do not know how much time Ill have to live yet, but what I know is that whatever Ill do, Ill continue to fail.I hate my job because I am full of work, underpaid and I cannot stand my boss attitude and a few of my colleagues. I am always stressed, nervous, angry and sad. Id like to leave the job, but I developed a fear of driving and the public transport is a mess where I live in. Even if I could face my fear, I would not have the money to buy a car.However, Ill have an interview tomorrow. Its a 90 minutes commute of walk, bus and train, but if they take me and the salary is a bit better Ill accept it, because if I continue this way Ill explode of anger and leave my current job before finding another one. But I have low expectations.At home it is not better. My father abandoned me even before my birth. I barely ever had a good relationship with my mother. Probably she sees in me her disappointment with my father and other men. But I am not a psychologist, so that is just my theory. She is unemployed and over-indebted and we will loose my grandparents house in the next years. I loved my grandparents and I love this house.

"This year has been a bit challenging emotionally. I am not really sure where to go with this as I hate burdening my loved ones with really unhappy things, so for now I am just going to yell into the void of Reddit so I can organize all my thoughts and get them out. In short: I am extremely unhappy with the person I seem to be recently. Its almost like I was a different person last year and even the year before that especially. I was happier. Everything was generally okay. Life felt good for the most part. And now, for the past 6 or 7 months or so, I have been largely a hot mess.It does not make much sense, because things are good right now. I should be happy. In December I moved into my own place with my partner who I love dearly, and everything between us is wonderful. We adopted a cat. I was able to find a job here in our new town right after moving. I have made acquaintances despite my horrible social anxiety. In theory, everything is *wonderful*. But for some reason, despite all that, I have spent the grand majority of this time going through cycles of misery. My self-esteem has hit an all time low, and that is saying something. I frequently put myself down. I feel like a failure despite my accomplishments. I have been crying almost daily, or at least several times a week. I seem to cry way more easily now, because I used to only cry every once in a while. I have many moments almost on the daily where I just feel very sad, angry, or grumpy. Sometimes my entire day will be ruined by one small thing and I will turn into an irritable unfun person for pretty much the rest of the day. I hate being this way. It cannot be fun for my loved ones, and its certainly not fun for me. I have been withdrawing from keeping in touch with friends, too. Deep down, I am afraid they secretly do not want to hear from me. I know how ridiculous that sounds but I cannot help thinking it.I am not sure if this is depression or what. I have struggled with anxiety and OCD since I was a child but I have never been to a psychologist about this specific issue. And now I am in a small town so access to in person therapy is rough to find. I am looking for telehealth options, but in the meantime I am unsure what to make of myself lately. Sometimes I worry I am just overreacting, but it cannot be okay to feel this way so consistently... right? Does this sound normal, or is it worth seeking help?",Depression

I honestly do not want to think like this but I am stuck in this rut I cannot get out of and I am not coping at all without thoughts of the future and how bleak and impossible everything looks. I have cut loads of people out and minimised contact for the past several years. I do not know if I have just been doing that because I want less people to hurt or it takes me too much energy or what. I do not feel I think too clearly about things like that. Sometimes it is easier having no one and keeping everything to yourself because people cannot be trusted. I feel worried about what will come of my failed suicide attempt.

"Since I can remember I have always been a sad child on the inside. I blame it on my parents. Our relationship is not that great, although I believe they never realized it because they have been to absorbed in their own opinions. I feel as if they never really loved me, because they have always been lacking emotional support. I know they try in their own way and they are not bad people but I still resent them to this day for deciding to have children if they do not know how to care for them. If I was sad or had any kind of problems my parents would always dismiss them as ""childish and irrelevant"", ""that will not matter in 5 years anyway"", ""do not be so sensitive"", ""you are such a crybaby"". So I learned from an early age to deal with any kind of emotional needs and distress on my own. In elementary school I used to have a lot of friends and I always used to pride myself with being a good and reliable friend. So when one of my friends was cast out because of something that was out of her control I stood by her side. And I was the only one that did. When the others decided to forgive her I was stranded alone, left behind by the only friend I had. With the beginning of puberty I developed an eating disorder that to this day has gone unnoticed to my parents. I used to skip breakfast, throw away my lunch at school and only eat one meal when I would come home. I was really skinny, kind of underweight. I would lay in my bed at night and my stomach would hurt, screaming at me to get some food and I would just lay there and enjoy it, feeling accomplished. It was not even about weight or looks, people always told me I was too skinny. It was simply about control. The only person I could rely on and that I trusted was my cat. I loved her very much. She would always sleep on my bed nearly every night. On the outside I was always a very happy person, that might even be something I was known for.It took some time, a lot of third-weeling and always being put on the back-burner until I found the great friends that I now have and I am unbelievably thankful for them. They are my only support system - a support system that I build on my own. From then on things went good for once. I was in school nearly all day - away from by parents, could spend time with my friends, got good grades, my eating disorder got better. I was really happy those couple years of my life. The happiest I have ever been. And then my cat died. She was with me for 10 years and there has never been anyone I have loved more than her. With 17 I got my first boyfriend and I was very happy. I honestly think if my cat had not died I would have stayed single but I felt so lonely after that. Things got bad pretty quickly. It started with yelling and jealousy, controlling behaviour. I noticed it, but I was too weak to break up. I was already in too deep and hoped that it would get better with time. I had a lot of compassion and understanding for him because I knew he had a rough childhood and saw some serious stuff. But of course it only got worse from there. Those 1 1/2 years where torture. I was being manipulated into feeling like the bad guy, worthless even when I was the one being insulted, held against my will, pushed, beaten, threatend and even raped. I regularly had bruises that I hid successfully from everyone else. I really tried to help him but I realised that there was nothing I could do without endangering myself. At the end of our relationship I was seriously suicidal. My eating disorder got really bad and I was critically underweight. My parents of course did not notice that either. I mustered all my strenght to break up with him and filed a report to the police (only for assault because that was the only thing I had any kind of evidence for).My father drove me to the police. They were considerate for like a week until they acted like nothing happend after that. My mother complained that I did not want to go to a family reunion we had planned, like she did not find out her daughter was assaulted for months three days ago. After that she told me something that I will never forget. She told me how bad SHE was suffering after hearing what happend to me and how bad of a mother she felt now, all whilst never asking how I was doing or offering any help. I was doing better for a couple of months, being relieved that I am not in that relationship anymore. But it has been getting worse. I have diagnosed insomnia and anxiety, now maybe even depression. Pills have not been helping and therapy is taking way to long to show effects. I have panic attacks that feel like I am dying. My parents are also not considerate of that or take it into account when interacting with me whatsoever. The last month I had a rough patch where I started driking alcohol and taking my medication I ways that I should not. I realise now that there was one incident where I nearly could have died.I have been trying to move out because I just need to get away from here. Everything here reminds me of bad things in the past and I feel trapped. My parents want to buy an appartment for me - which sounds nice at first, but it is only in their interest. They do not want to pay money to rent, they want to earn money from the real estate and because nobody wants to sell we have been searching for months unsuccessfully. When I mentioned that a friend wanted to rent an apartment in the same city, around the same time and suggested we search together and split rents as roomates they threatend that I would need to sue them for the money that they would be legally obligated to pay me (where I live parents have to pay you money to live until you finish your degree). So as you see people in my life have always made it unnecessarily hard for me. I hope I can move out very soon or I will go insane. People made my life very hard - telling my story",Suicidal

I was also a little sheltered growing up which does not help either. My parents were helicopter-y and devout Christians so a lot of activities that others may consider okay/fun is hard for me to enjoy or partake in without an immense amount of guilt and shame.

Since the lockdown he turned worse and he had started showing various other signs like he used to laugh alone and cry alone, lack of appetite and etc. On consulting the doctor, he had ruled out saying that this is an issue of depression and something realted to neurology and asked him to be admitted immediately. That phase where he had gone under medication was very hard because he spoke with long pauses and had saliva drolling all over ( which was said because of the effect of medicines for the neurological issue) he was admitted in a hospital and there was a night where his pulse rate had gone very high because of which they had rushed to another hospital to get a CT scan done ( apparently the hospital did not even have a CT scan equipment). He was okay once his school started and he kept complaining about boredom and his loneliness (because he had no friends), the doctor had advised to stop the tablets he was taking ""for sleep"" (which i assume to be anxiety pills). His behaviour has taken a different turn now, from being like a tortoise in a she will to a more violent kind of behaviour and i just received a call saying he was about to beat up his mother. I am genuinely worried after hearing all this! I feel so angry about the lack of awareness of mental health in my country and him not having a right channel to help himself. I am going through issues of my own and am just worried wether this is more than depression and the doctors not looking in the angel where they suspect him of BIPOLAR DISORDER makes me even more anxious. I do not really trust the doctors treating him, my family does not agree with me! I really do not know what to do. To be frank I am just worried I might lose him! If there are any psychologist in this subreddit, please as to what you think he is going through and how can i help him! I have a cousin suffering from depression and i do not know how to help him",Depression

"I had a really bad interaction with my psychologist. She was the first one I went to after a series of bad experiences with different psychologists. I was so afraid to see a new one because if I did and it went badly, it felt like there would be no hope left. But the day I decided to see her was the day after the closest I would ever come to suicide. It was after some emotional experiences that left me feeling like I could not go on anymore. I did not want to hurt my mom so I reached out for help. I saw this woman for nearly a year but recently her response to my suicidal thoughts was downright unprofessional and hurtful. She reprimanded me and told me to think about what my suicide would do to her. And she set up these ridiculous rules that any time I mentioned even a thought of suicide or self harm the first thing she would do is call my dad. Mind you I am in my 20s. She had no right to break my patient confidentiality like that. When I told her that if she set that rule, I just would not talk to her about such feelings which would make it much harder to reach out for help. She basically did not care. She was the first psychologist who did not dismiss my feelings. When I told her I felt so bad that I needed to be hospitalized, she sent me to a psychiatrist who was incredibly dismissive of my feelings and then made a change to my meds that included quitting the meds I would been on for 2 years in three days. I felt awful. And I felt like I lost all trust for that psychiatrist. This is not my first experience with mental health professionals and they have basically all been bad. I do not know what to do anymore. I feel like I am at my rope's end. All I think about is death to the point where I feel unable to hold a normal conversation. It consumes me. I have no filter either so I feel like the only way to save others from hearing these awful thoughts is to stop talking to them. I feel alone. I feel like a burden. I know I am a burden. And I do not know if I want to live anymore. I do not know if I want help anymore if this is what help looks like. A bad experience with a psychologist",Depression
I have been struggling a lot more than usual due to a lot of stress. I feel like my whole life is a mess. I have had no serious relationships in over 15 years and I still find myself constantly looking at my exs (yes from 15 years ago) social media pages. I am always financially struggling and feel like I am worth more dead than alive. Suicide is always in the back of my mind but its usually just a thought and not something I think I could ever act on. I am always stressed out over work and working excessive hours over the last few months. Working out has always been my way to cope but I have been unmotivated and more enticed by alcohol instead. I have some friends but I feel like they do not really like me and I constantly go over all of the things I say wondering if they talk about me if I say something stupid. I want to workout more and be more sociable but I do not know how to energize myself to do it. I was doing really well from Jan - April but after that I have just gone downhill. I was in therapy but I was doing so well that I did not need it anymore. I hate to go back with my tail between my legs like I failed. So has anyone had any success with motivation and/or coping?Sorry its so long and thank you for reading! How do you motivate yourself to do better?,Depression

"Hello my name is thomas. I have been feeling weird kind of symptoms and I would like to have some help to get to know what is going on with me. My symptoms are bothering me and I would like to have some guidance on what to do and what they are. So basically about 2-3months ago I started having panick attacks. I was feeling anxious pretty much everyday. I was not happy with this pandemic, school and my friends. I was starting to feel down. Also, I would feel very anxious about my health. Every sensation in my body that was odd I would focus on it and react in a small stress. I would vegan to panick when I would get a panic attack even tho I knew it was that. I would still panic and wait. Also after my panic attacks I would feel weird odd symptoms the few following days. I would feel low on energy, chills and weird zaps in my head. Until one day, in may, I started being very irritated at everything and I would constantly get uncomfortable symptoms when I did daily activities like gym, go out with friends. I would feel very light sensitive, a tiny nausea some times and a lot of stress when I got odd symptoms. There would also be this feeling of fear and feeling down. Even tho I was with my girlfriend I constantly had this weird fear of living. I would think I would die any second when I would experience odd symptoms. Then In June it got worse. I was having anxiety symptoms and panic attacks almost everyday. I would say 5 time a week. I notice during the day I would get this sick feeling with all kinds of symptoms. Per exemple i would feel my body changing temperature, brain zaps, my heart beat felt irregular, I was getting very tired and feeling very drowsy. And then it escalated into a panic attack. But when it was in the evening I would feel completely normal and everything was fine. But I would start to think about why was I feeling that and trying to figure out what was going on with my brain and body. So I would worry and overthink. And the cycle would continue. Until one day the June 15, after having bad anxiety symptoms, I notice a numbness in my brain. Like I could not feel my emotions anymore. I was trying to feel happy, I know that I was happy, I was able to express it but I could not feel it. So I started panicking about that. As the days went by the panick attacks were slowly fading away, and when I was having one, I felt the physical sensations but my brain like did not care. I did not feel that adrenaline rush and that panic feeling. I cannot feel stress anymore. Its very hard to feel love, happy, satisfied. My pschyatrist prescribed me 25mg sertaline and said that that would help. I kept explaining her my symptoms and she was saying its all anxiety and seem like she did not care. I did a blood test, it came back fine. Right before I started the meditation, the numbness and my physical symptoms were very bad. I lost the feeling of hunger and fullness, the ability to feel tired, to feel heat, and to feel emotions. It felt like if my brain had a brick wall the seperates me from feeling my body. you can feel the empty feeling. Now I am on week 3 of sertaline and some symptoms calmed down. But I am still experiencing this numbness. I would wake up and feel like empty. I still get trouble feeling hunger and I get weird stools. I am still a bit worried on what is going on with my body. Can you help me re assure what I am having and teach me techniques to overcome this suffering please I would really appreciate it. I am sick of feeling like this MY STORY I am SICK OF THIS SOMEONE HELP",Depression

"Monday through Friday I am fine. I have some hard days but for the most part, I do ok. Then the weekend comes and it is awful. I realize how lonely I really am. I realize how I have absolutely no one. I try to stay active, but I am just doing everything by myself. I try to invite people to do things but they already have plans. I have tried to go places to meet new people but I end up in places with absolutely no way to meet new people.I wanted a family, I wanted the warmth that comes with it. I loved having someone to love and care for. But I think if this is my default I would rather be alone. Maybe it is greedy of me to want someone in my life because it holds off the loneliness. If I cannot be happy alone doing everything on my own then maybe I do not deserve a partner or a family. I have talked to people and have dated but even that makes me feel lonely. Its not having people, I am just like this. I just do not feel like I belong in this world. I do not feel like there is a place for me here. I live in a big city and I cannot seem to find a place for me. There was one person who made me feel like I had a place in this world and I pushed them away.I am speaking to a therapist and am on medication. they are working as good as they can. I do notice a difference then before when I was not on them. At least now I just feel sad instead of suicidal. I have barely been able to go to the grocery store. I have barely been able to take care of tasks that need to be done. I just feel like I am existing. I am sure at some point this feeling will go away for a few weeks but then it will come back again. I hate being alone. I hate doing everything alone. I hate that even when I am with people doing things, I still feel alone. I think I just want to be alone and not plague anyone with my burdens",Depression

"I am finding it really difficult to find both motivation and any sense of self-worth. I have been on furlough for over a year now, am in-between jobs, been through a difficult break-up that ended badly, at home I am often belittled by my mom (not always) and my cat is very ill. I am grateful for what I have, I know these issues are not at all unbearable for most, but I guess I am just weaker. I have barely any friends (none in my area) and the few friends that I do have are too busy for me, so I installed Bumble BFF and reinstalled Instagram to try to meet new people. It feels a bit pathetic only having one post on Instagram when everyone has dozens and I am alone in the photos as well. I have been trying to make friends where I live for the past 8 years and nothing. *I feel like I sound like a very irritating and miserable child but I really do not mean to, I am sorry.* I also used to go jogging but it is been too warm so I stopped. I also used to work out at home, but I do not feel comfortable at home most times. Asides from that, nothing really brings much sense of worth from me, I like singing but am not at all great at it, the same goes on with the rest of my hobbies. I bought this volleyball so that I and the person I was seeing could go play at some point in the park, but we never got to, and now it is deflated and always in the way.&amp;#x200B; Today I took a big (for me) step and played some dance games for a little bit and that helped pass the time as well as do a little bit of cardio. But now I am once again alone, mom is being difficult today so am isolating in my room, I am tired of Ted Talks and trying to self-improve, I am tired of Netflix, I am tired of video games, I am tired of reading. I cannot eat, I can barely sleep, I literally just do everything I can to distract myself and try to pass the time. I have been heading off to bed at 9pm because there is simply nothing to do, there is no one to talk to, no messages, if I send any I would be ignored.

Maybe do not look for an escape, do not look for a way out, but to look for a way to cope. A way to look at the brighter side. A way to live in one with these demons, with these tortures and all as it is part of life. It is what we cast upon ourselves due to whatever we have going on.

"I am gay and I have never really had any struggle with my family and friends accepting this but I have always had a problem with myself because of it. I guess I could call it internalised homophobia. I was in straight relationships growing up, but would find a way to ease my thoughts of being gay by watching lesbian tv shows or shows with lesbian relationships. This meant that I would get overly attached with the characters and if they would break up or argue I would spiral into a depressive state that I would have to have therapy to help get back to a normal place. Now I am 21 and I have never had a gay relationship but I am openly gay and am finding ways to except that within myself. The problem is that I still fantasise about women I like in tv shows and the actresses that play them, but its not necessarily that I want to be with them, its that I want to be them. I start to change my lifestyle, my clothing and things like that to mimic how a certain character acts. I talk about them day in and day out and it drowns me with emotion. It has not always been fictional women either as in school I found myself obsessed with female members of staff to the point where Id get so depressed knowing I could never be them and part of me would confuse this feeling for being in love.

"I want to die not just for no reason at all. Its not just a deep depression or something. Its a simple awareness of what life really is and what a fucked up cycle it is. We are just vessels through which DNA gets to propagate itself. All life forms are but were all competing for which DNA lineage gets to dominate, control and consume the rest of them. Humans have obviously already won that battle. Its all just a sick competition between life forms trying to kill, steal, dominate, take advantage of one another and it cannot change.

"preface is that i do actually suffer from clinical depression and i used to take 150mg zoloft but I have been off that bc i moved and my psychiatrist does not accept how far i moved so I am out of meds. the withdrawal sucked for a few weeks but I am feeling okay now. my problem comes from the fact that i need to get a job. normally it takes me a few months to get over the decision making stage of work or commit suicide and I am over that stage now and decided to work but I am just stuck here now because the closest place is like a 30 minute bike ride? i applied anyways and they have not gotten back to me but I am just concerned because i do not think I am strong enough to just bootstrap my way into both learning to ride and riding 5 days a week in 90+ degree weather. i have a few months left to live where i stay unless i get a job and my accounts are all depleted so I am just like okay yeah let us get a job but i rode there once and i had to literally sit and pant for like 15 minutes lol. i do not doubt that its possible bc i see people all the time but it just feels like its dangerously hot for me and everything thinks its just because I am from a colder climate but the temperature out here is enough to put me on my ass easily, i just do not have any other way to get money.. and i do not know if I am strong enough to take that trip but even worse is that its been 2 weeks and i have not gotten a call back. if this place does not hire me then I am screwed and ill have to bike even further or die so I am just like fuck what do i do! sorry i just woke up and this is more of a rant but this scenario has been on my mind forever. i considered ubering to work if i get hired but idk i do not know if I am lazy or not",Depression
"I am having suicidal thoughts lately just because of my health issues.It all started in 2018 initially, I was all heathy and good but all of a sudden I developed frequent urination, along with that kicked in my health anxiety. It took my some months but finally I got over it! For a year it was all good, then I got acidity issue then later on I developed tinnitus which was the most devastating phase in my life. I lost my girl, whom i loved more than anything because of this, I cut out myself from social areas. For an year you can say entire 2020 went in recovering from that, finally when I was feeling better and started moving on, bamm, another issue popped up, i had allergies.Then while dealing with that at some point i got severe upper respiratory infection because of which again meds!Now after that, i took the vaccine, now i see I have pigmentation in my buccal mucosa, all the dentists are saying its normal but dermatologists stated its oral lichen planus! Idk what to do, all these diseases which are non-curable re coming to me! What is my fault, why m i having to suffer all these?Now I am scared of cancer and this gives me heath anxiety most of the time! I really feel so hopeless, i feel like my body is not supporting me.

"Single 33M. I moved in with my parents a few months ago. I left LA due to the fact that rent was high, and all of my work had become remote due to the pandemic, so I saw an opportunity to save a lot of money. However, following a breakup, I have been pretty depressed. However, I cannot help but wonder if some of this depression is due to living at home. My parents are not overbearing and they have been very accomodating, but I am starting to wonder if living with them is not good for me mentally. I have always valued my independence and liked living in bigger cities where I am surrounded by people like me.Before moving home, the primary problem was anxiety and panic.

My outer family probably thinks I am someone who has had life too easy, and honestly, they are probably right in many ways. I love most of my friends, but I can never talk to them about my personal life, because I have built a facade of being an emotionless goofball. Even moments where I stay quiet for more than five minutes are enough for people to assume something is not going right with me, so how can I ever tell them what is really going on?My co-workers think I am pleasant and nice, but probably assume my personality is non existent. I am in line to have terrific job prospects once I graduate, yet I could not care less. Even after a post-puberty transformation that makes me a fairly decent looking person, I have never had a girlfriend, largely due to the insecurities I have maintained through my puberty years, when I was flat out ugly. Dating sites have horrible response rates, and even if I feel like there is a good conversation going, I always end up getting ghosted.there is also the fact that I am non-binary and in the closet, but cannot see a reality where I am able to love this part of myself, have a loving partner embrace me for who I am, or accepted my by family.I feel incredibly silly even writing this, because of how much privilege I have had through my life.

"Hello everyone, i was reading a lot of your stories and i always wanted to post something but never did because i did not want to bother anyone and i felt that i did not deserved any attention.But in some extreme efforts to try to get better, i convinced myself to do it, so here i am.Since i Can remember, i always had a lot of depression phases 2/3 times a year, but i was at maximum a month. Unfortunately, i had a big trauma in 2017, an since then, I am depressed all day. I tried some medication in a short period of Time (2 months) but i could not recognize myself as i take it. I was miserable, could not do anything and when i realized i go panic attacks that made it worth. And even After that, when i tried to stop medication, i could not stop right away because of the weaning time. So now I am scared of that but i still feel, it is the only solution.I am followed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist, so I am not on my own. Also, even if it is like carrying a Mountain, i made my life proper again. I start a formation in september in alternation, I am in a relationship and everything is going well, and he understands and help me with this, I am getting my driver license (which was hard to start because of traumatism younger) .... So it is really good ! But the more i try to move forward in life, the more i feel bad.My brain feels foggy, my heart hurts me everytime, i wake up everyday only wanting to end me and my day and i needs so much effort not to have any rewards. Everything is worst than before. I am doing sport every two days, I am forcing myself to have some sociabilisation, I am good looking, I am still clever.... But i cannot be happy and it feels like there is nothing i cannot do at this point. Even worse, people just tell me that they do not know why i feel so miserable while i got everything for me. I feel guilty not to be better, and it sadden me even more. it is an awful loop where I am in and ....

"I do not condone suicide, but I need to share something. It could be a long post. I have cerebral palsy. Not the severest, not the lightest case, but visible and affecting my movement. I cannot walk if there is no one to help me maintain balance. No cure for this AFAIK.My family never supported me emotionally regarding my disability. I have no supporting community in my real life. I am 26, so it is a little late for me to don my pink optimistic glasses on. My past is a fact. Lonely and full of bullying. Little to experience with significant others. I guess able-bodied people find me sexually unattractive. Given that even I could not see myself giving someone a chance if I strongly dislike their looks, I suppose some people work like that. I get the ""exercise/ do yoga or it is your fault"" plus the occasional ""or you will be reincarnated in a similar body"" very often. I tried rehabilitation, but the arduous process leads to nothing that could be deemed a motivating goal. My physiotherapist congratulates me upon being able to use my legs muscles to stand up from a chair. Awesome achievement indeed. I probably deserve a medal for that. If there was anything I could do to get closer to the ""standard"" of a sexy young male I guess I would do it. But nopez. Me training means me suffering in order to gain some basic abilities and it is not 100% even that would work as expected. This body is awful. So I expect I will either die alone or have to marry someone who is also undateable. Given my past traumas I think I would be a weird partner to be with anyway.I am otherwise somewhat successful, but that brings joy. Amidst all of this, I should have the motivation to work on my PhD, while living in one of the bad places to be disabled in (post-Soviet Eastern Europe). Mom does not want to immigrate, so I guess I am stuck here.Honestly, it is so bad that I cannot even kill myself. I wake up, day after day, trying my best to do my job and seem fine, while seeing literally every other person around me pursue the goal of a relationsip/ family or have one and attempt to be happy. Or all those people who seem happy. Family and relationships are the meaning of life unless one could be a monk.Seeing that I am not that much interested in Eastern Orthodox Christianity (or any Christian dogma in general) that is not an option either. Not that anyone cares. Life in society has ""accepted"" me as an observer who sacrifices their labour and gets a little money in return. And so the years shall go, it seems. I have waited for ""better days"" far too long. it is easier to dissmiss someone disabled.All I want is for this to end. I wish no hell nor paradise, just the ending of this. I have 0 control of how/ whether my death makes others suffer; my suffering makes them go away anyway. If there is any spiritual essence in me I would like that to serve its purpose or whatever the truth is.But I cannot bear all the suffering in utter loneliness. Giving all and getting little. Always doomed to being an outcast however strong my wish to simply belong. I wish euthanasia was legal, but alas. Sometimes suicide IS the only actual option",Depression

"Hello everyone. I have been dealing with chronic back pain for the last 3 years and had surgery about 6 months ago for it. Unfortunately it did not help much with the pain and I am looking to go into another surgery. This injury has taken everything from me. I use to deal with all my anxiety and depression through physical activity and now I am unable to use it as a coping mechanism anymore. Suicide is always on my mind and I have already made a coupple pathedic attempts at ODing and cutting.Through trips to the hospital and psych ward I still have not been able to find the proper resources to help me mentally. I have been on and off medication for my depression but they just seem to make me more suicidal... like I said, physical activity was always the best outlet for me. I have tried the hotline many times and I find that this resource is very limited, the help you recieve is far from what your get from a real psychologist. I am hoping that once I get on disability more resources will become available to me.Throughout my disability I have not able to get disability payments from the government as my girlfriend had been looking after me. Unfortunately it is been a toxic and terrible relationship. She had came into the relationship with terrible insecurity issues derived from her previous relationship and things kind of came to a head when my back went out three years ago. I have been ridiculed and tormented for ""cheating"" while I am laying on the floor withering in pain barely able to do anything. I am now at a stage where I cannot take it anymore, she is out of the house, and I am now waiting for my disability payments to come through. In the mean time I am sure my landlord will understand that I cannot come up with rent on time, but I need money for my medications and food. A friend of mine started a fund raiser for me and I would love if any of you could help in any way. I really appreciate it.I am in a crisis mentally, physically, and financially. Any support whether it be through advice, just chatting, or it you choose to donate, would be greatly appreciated. been taking deep breaths and just trying to take things one step at a time.

"you all ever...feel the opposite of what you are actually feeling?I have always been a bit of a weirdo when it comes to expressing happy emotions. I do weird physical ticks I am no longer sure are normal. Things like squealing or flapping my hands like I am a fucking seal or something idk. Maybe that is why I was misdiagnosed with autism XD (or was I? I might never know) but that is besides the point.Now days, whenever I get intensely excited or happy, I notice it makes me want to cry. Like, I get brief flashes over stupid things like the book I am reading or a game. I get happy but its like I do not know what to do with it so I have the opposite reaction instead, like wanting to cry or literally forcing myself into a worse mood. Or, brief flashes of excitement that set off like a bomb in my head but sputter out within seconds. I know that sounds strange. Idk if its because I just do not know how to be happy or if I am afraid of it or what. I just do not *let* myself be excited or happy anymore. Maybe I am afraid that I am not enjoying the things I am excited about properly, so I just do not? Like that makes any fucking sense? Idk. Any of you have experiences with this?

"Do any of you people take stimulants like adderall or ritalin to cope with depression and lack of energy and motivation. I feel it hellps with mood for sometime but then again the crash is followed by depression and exhaustion. Also, it causes anxiety and blood pressure at the start after taking it and makes my feet extremely cold.

"I am feeling a lot of existential dread at the fact I am almost 30 and have achieved nothing worthy of notice. I have suffered depression and anxiety since I was 18 years old, and I have always managed to overcome it, until the past 2 years. I am stuck in a house I despise, to the point where I live in my bedroom cos it is my only ""safe"" area and cannot afford to repair or move because I only earn 7k a year as a cleaner. I have applied for endless jobs to try and improve, giving up on finding jobs relating to my degree (illustration and design), because the Northeast of England just does not have those kinds of opportunities. I work freelance, and have tried running an Etsy selling merchandise, but have been on a 2 year hiatus because I am slowly losing the will to see why.I have applied for so many jobs and constantly get rejections, my manager was kind enough to offer me receptionist shifts now and then. But even with that experience I am still not good enough. I recently dabbled in OF, not for money related reasons, but for some kind of self-love and confidence boost. I stopped because it felt pointless, even when earning a little. I also stream occasionally for fun, but I have even lost enjoyment from that. I am at a point where I just no longer want to exist. I have been in bed for days and feel a burden to my partner, who has been ever so kind to me. I feel like I do not deserve his help in all honestly. I tried ringing my doctor about some therapy, I was referred again to a UK company called Talking Changes, which were useless to me in the past. When I told my doctor this he just said well I cannot do anything else, so I never asked for help since, that was also 2 years ago.I tried talking to my parents about how I feel, and as I broke down crying, I was snapped at for being upset as it does not help anything and it is ""no use crying"". I just ended up driving home, whilst crying my eyes out. That was the last time I got out of bed, 4 days ago. I am not drinking anything, I am not eating, I just want to slowly shut down, because I see no end to this persistent hell. I never wanted a big fancy life, all I wanted was to be happy and content, to feel like I was worth at least something. All of my friends are making big achievements, getting big promotions, buying nice houses, even my bullies are achieving more. And I am just a loser like I always was. Just basic bitch me. I know if I could at least afford to move house, it would be a start and I would feel comfortable. But it is like the universe is fighting against everything I do.

"I get easily frustrated by so many things. Few examples I have in mind:When politicians wear their masks when they talk in a microphone: there is nobody next to you and you need to relay a message do not you? stop this posturing I cannot understand your muffleling! (that one is not going to be popular but bear with me please)That commercial that just explodes my phone speaker everytime it pops up on Youtube: How bad are you willing to bother me just to make profit?Bella Poarch: I feel like she is so fake and ""Pretend-cute"", I doubt she is half as cute in real life.Jeff Bezos who goes to space: have not you got anything better to do with your money? like helping the poor you know, one of those trivial thingsAnd anyways, my therapist told me to accept those things. She said:"" When you think about an object in your room, it does not bother you, right? well try to have the same attitude towards those things that frustrate you"". You do not get angry about a ventilator in the corner of your room, you do not get angry about the wind.. etc.She also told me ""what does it concern you if someone is fake?"" which is interesting. it is true that it is not my problem that Bella Poarch is the way she is. Also I simply cannot change her, I do not even have enough money to buy a plane ticket to meet her, so what is the point in hating her? I feel like she makes the world worse and I dislike her for that, she does not contribute anything to the world and she is a millionair.I think it is fair to cast judgements, some things are bad and some things are good, but according to my therapist, there is a way to accept those things, be at peace with the world. A way of relating to things we think are bad without feeling the need to reject them, hate them, change them.

You talk and talk. You seriously believe just because your life is perfect and you get EVERYTHING you want means that everyone can do it and they are just NOT TRYING HARD ENOUGH. FUCK YOU! Just because YOU are happy being alone does not mean that everyone can be. Just because you are happy with never being loved does not mean that everyone can feel the same. Just because you do not care that you are horrendously shit at conversation does not mean that everyone can accept it. Just because you are fine with being unfuckable does not mean everyone likes being it. Stop being so fucking arrogant and ignorant. Admitting these things does not mean that you are shit and that you should kill yourself. If you can deal with it, GOOD FUCKING JOB! No, seriously, I am glad that you are fine with yourself.

I feel like I am always prophesizing about another illness he will have, even though, thank god, he is a cure, happy and healthy baby (aside from the occasional colds and other shit little kids constantly get). Even though I know that most parents deal with this and tend to their children and move on, I feel like this is consuming me to the point where I am convinced that by dying, I will finally be free of this pain and anxiety and can finally be calm and maybe happy.

I do not have employer health insurance and will not be able to go to the doctor anymore, let alone afford therapy or counseling.My current job at an arcade is filled with constant customer abuse, usually microaggressions about policies or prices or just dumb people not reading instructions on games, shitty looks and tones of voice and stuff like that which builds and builds until any particularly aggressive, attacking customer is automatically too much for me to handle, but if I in any way engage their shit behavior the onus is on me to ""disengage"" altogether. I never have any real backup from management, it is just constant abuse and then punishment/writeups if I get mad back at a customer for being blatantly mean or harassing. I am pretty sure I am at the end of my rope with the company, I think I may be receiving my final warning today, and I cannot stomach the thought of remaining in a retail environment anymore if I do get fired.

But I am 99% certain they are going to screw me over on that one. I have been looking for alternative places to work on the side, but it is just becoming clearer and clearer that my lack of a degree is constraining me to abusive retail environments and not much else. I feel genuinely like a drain on society, utterly replaceable.I cannot afford health insurance outside of my employer with the wages I am making currently, I am barely making my rent and car insurance as is. People have recommended government assistance but I have also heard that is a bad idea and i do not know who to believe, or if I would even qualify, and it is immensely stressing me out after dealing with the clustercuss of unemployment for the greater part of last year.I have tried applying at various places and have not really heard anything back.

I am on the verge of just packing up and moving, but then I would lose access to my primary physician, and I am terrified of going homeless again like I was in 2014/15.My anxiety and stress are boiling over, i think this is a lower point than I was at in 2010 when i got checked into a ward. I know other people have it way harder than me overall, but I genuinely cannot think of a way to make my life actually worth living anymore, instead of a constant grinding to ""survive"". I know I am fortunate to have a job at all, I just cannot handle the abuse anymore. I keep wanting a way out and I am scaring myself that I may actually do it this time.... I do not have a plan, just keep having errant thoughts while I am driving to just go into a lake or off a cliff or stuff like that... I am scaring myself.. I am at my wit's end",Suicidal
"it was a different day in a weird way, in an almost bad way. i saw someone explaining about once a person has mastered the art of acceptance, nothing can hurt them anymore. but that meant that the person had barely to almost no sympathy, i cannot see myself being like that especially to her. then later on i had a panic attack, i could not do anything it was a whole mess. the night was ruined. i was full of anger at myself, i was fully anguished. i accidentally showed that i was not doing well and was done with everything while talking to someone, i was terrified at what i had just done. my whole mind was a war zone, i was not thinking straight, this was the first time in a while i showed the emotion of not being able to handle it anymore to someone, i was scared because previous experiences especially with my ex did not end well, my heart was feeling every bit of nothing, just empty and shallow. but it did not end bad, i actually got a message about how much they cared about me, it made me feel a whole lot better but i still had to get because i felt as if i just embarrassed myself. in the middle of my heart tearing apart from the pain, it was nice. it was nice to even see that she would write its that much, yet alone she wrote me a paragraph about how much she cared about me. the past week I have been praying she would say something like that, I am so glad it happened because its still on my mind and its been almost 24 hours and i cannot get it off of my chest, its nice to see she cares so much. today_i hate how I am so late, I am the wrong person who was here at the right time once, but now the wrong person at the wrong time. almost as if i got the last piece of the cake, which was tiny compared to the other pieces. i hate how people ruined her experience and i cannot get a chance with her nor her full trust, but its how life goes; life is a whole lie. funny thing to mention she mentions how she likes girls and I am pretty sure its satire i think? but it does make me smile in a laughing matter but then i just realise that i really do not have any chances with her, I am just here. I have been unlucky my entire life leading up to this point, my dad hates me so much that I am not even hurt anymore when he says hurtful things to me its normal, my mum sometimes goes out of her conscience and supports him. but i feel so terrible, feel like a shitty son for hating them, and end up forgiving her and him, but then it happens all over again its a cycle of never ending pain. I have been unlucky for quite a while but if I am able to one day get her then ill be more than just satisfied, i just want to be her safe person. it would be a shame if i lost her to some other guy, even sadder if her jokes about her liking girls came true haha, but as long as that person can keep her happier than i ever could then ill be okay. i wish i could go back to the time when me and her first started talking, then till now, she is the most beautiful girl I have ever met, the most valuable smile and the most precious eyes, they were like gem stones but of an odd colour for a gem, i loved it so much when her eyes locked into mine, i was really floating. i messed up. i cannot make her happy and make her laugh like i used to be able to, I am losing the only bit of value to her that i ever had. i hope this nightmare ends one day, and i never wake up. i hope i get stuck between a nightmare ending and waking up, where I am waiting for nothing, just complete blank and am never able to make it out, my heart hurts more and more everyday, and I am too selfish taking care of myself and trying to heal that i cannot even help her. i not only wish to die but also feel like i deserve to. anyways, cya yesterday was a different day",Depression

"A few months back my bird died, then my ex broke up a month ago and wanted me to leave our flat, since i am having breakdowns because i cannot find apartments that i can pay for and are big enough for me and my pets (well i found some, applied for them and got rejected), i have to leave this wonderful home, my first home and safe place. I lost my only family with my ex. And while all that is not enough (and of course my mental health also got way worse again) i have financial problems, i do not know if i have enough money to live on my own yet living with a stranger is impossible for me. I do not know how to pay for moving and for the new furniture i need. I also need to pay some other stuff for my health which is freaking expensive as well. And yet its not ending here, my bird is getting more and more sick and there is nothing i can do about it except wait until he dies or put him down. Its not that he is in a lot of pain or something, but he is getting weaker and weaker - i mean sure he already lived for a while and is just old... but its just too much for me especially bc i have to give away my other bird when my sick one died so she is not alone. I want the vest life for her and i already know where i can leave her to so that she can be happy without my other bird but... its just awful. Why is everything at once? Its not just dealing with a breakup, i think that would be so much easier even tho it is very hard for me as well bc he is my sould mate. Why cannot it just be one by one instead of all at once...?

"I do not know how to deal with all of them. Medication (citalopram) did not help and it made me dizzy so I quit. Its been almost 3 years since my burnout started and I had to quit college and my job but I am still showing no signs of recovery. Its driving me nuts.In 2017/2018 I worked so hard to lose weight (75 lbs) and succeeded. Now I gained more back (like 80 lbs) then I lost and my therapists any told me that there is nothing I can do about that at the moment. But I have already been waiting 2 years and 8 months. I am at my wits end.I am slowly seeing myself gaining more and more weight which is absolutely ruining my mental and physical health. I am too afraid to go outside in daylight because I am scared people I know will see I gained all of the weight back. Especially the people who used to bully me. My therapist recommended focusing only walking 15 minutes at night but that is already really tiring for me. It makes me really dizzy and tired. I only succeeded in doing it for one week recently I have been thinking I do not want to live anymore so often and its scaring me. I feel like I am out of options.

"I have very sever (diagnosed) OCD. My psychiatrist does not like labels so she does not even tell me if what I am feeling is because of depression. Basically, I fear seeing/guessing coincidences. I am mad scared that they might make me believe that they were somehow signs. I have had many coincidence happening to me where I thought for example beforehand: ""If I see a car with XXXX license plate it means I am in hell"". And It happened. I know it is probably bullshit, but my brain internalized the fear of ""being in hell"" now and for over 9 months I have been feeling really sad and empty. Like even in nature where I usually used to feel well and happy, I now feel really down and I remember the ""what if I am in hell or what if God is evil"" and then I become even worse. I cannot be happy anymore. My cat died and I did not even felt sad, I feel a helpless void because of this thing that happened with the license plates. it is ridiculous, but it is how I feel everyday. It just gets better when I am distracted doing something, but as soon as I am left with my thoughts the sadness creeps in. I am on an antidepressant btw. Can this be depression?

"I would rather be depressed miserable, pessimist, whatever else people enjoy labelling me as; and be real with everyone all year round; than literally just exude fake happiness which just exposes people's clear insecurities.People would rather walk around with a plastered smile that looks so forced and energy depleting rather than wait and be disciplined for the real and genuine smile when you meet with something, a person a situation that makes you really happy.What is the point in trying to *convince others* of your apparent so called 'happiness' 'higher frequency' bullshit when all it does is make others feel bad and guilty for their depression and difficult times in their lives?I am not saying you should not strive for it and *obviously* faking happiness can be a good way to get there. But I actually think real problem solving in your life is the only way to find true happiness. Faking it is just away to avoid the real issues in your life that are not changing. Maybe start with that before enforcing your toxic positivity rules onto others. I am talking to you twitter. Genuine happy is better than fake happy",Depression

"Very sad and angry and not in control of my emotions. I keep remembering all the things my piece of shit parents, grandparents, siblings and other people did to me. Even the things I have done. I am FAR from innocent in the situation. I just wish my parents were not fucking breeders so I would not have to go through these intense emotions caused by them because they had a child and was not able to be there for me. I hate them and wish I could never see them again. I NEVER felt safe around those people. My father was always quick to hit somebody and my mom did nothing when he choked slammed me then kicked me afterwards.SHE WAS RIGHT FUCKING THERE! When I asked why she just let it happened,she just said that I needed to behave properly. I guess that she wanted us to know how it felt to get hit by him like that. She always let him hit her all the time because she was too stupid and coward to kick his ass out. Nobody better tell me some stupid shit about loving your parents unconditionally because they did not love me that way. They could not even protect me. They betrayed me. I owe them nothing,absolutely nothing at all. Anytime I went to them when I needed them they blamed me instead of trying to help.At this point in my life,he abandoned us. But before he did,he had two outside kids with two different women and went with one of the women. And he dares to demand affection and understanding from us. And that is not even the good part. All of my family members on his side agree with him doing all of this and a cousin even threatened to beat me because I refused to talk to them because they saw nothing wrong with what he did. I do not even see the point anymore in anything. Anyway I am rambling,this rant is over. Emotional turmoil",Suicidal
"Just a few years ago I was 100% sure I had some form of brain cancer or a serious disability. I was clumsy, had minimal motor skills, among other things that affected me physically. I was unable to perform simple mathematichal tasks, my ability to think logically was almost gone, I had trouble understanding what I read. I felt so so stupid. My social life crumbled due to poor social skills. I was also almost sure I was in the spectrum because of this. I felt like a 5 year old in a 22 year olds body. I have had a spiral of depression since I was 14. I did the mistake of googling the effects of what years of untreated depression does to the brain. It was possible that I could lose my cognitive abilities forever. The chance of me getting my brain functioning normally was now only half. It was the first time I thought about taking my own life. There was not supposed to be a future for me. But I new what happens to people who do not go can ask for help. I did not want to die. Turns out, it was not scary at all. Getting help. At first it was a school psychologist, then a doctor, then therapy. In therapy they made me do all kinds of test that included evaluation of cognitive abilities and things related. All test results were below average, some were far away from average. I was mortified. I found out I have ADD and depression made it so much worse, hence me believing I have brain cancer. Due to right kind of support and therapy I am strarting to gain what I lost over the years. It took a while but I finally feel I am able to have a job or go to school allthough it still feels absolutely terrifying but I am currently at a job I like and I am actually good at it. I have a wonderful loving husband, a home I feel safe in, a social life, I am able to enjoy things and feel sincere joy regardless of everyday struggles I have. It was so much worth it to get help. There are so many good things in life that I was blind to. The moral of the story is that it is worth it to get help. And it is not as hard and scary as it seems. Recovery is possible.

"I have been living alone since June and all of my roommates work back at their hometown for the summer. (I am in college). It is currently killing me inside being alone.With not having any of my friends in town, I have been able to hang out with some other people i never really got to know until this summer. Truly, i really like this group of people that I have gotten closer with, the only problem is I have managed to catch extreme feelings with one of the girls there. She feels the exact same way towards me.. in a way. She got out of a relationship this past May and long story short, she wanted to stay as friends because we just were not on the same level. she is just not ready for anything despite the feelings she has for me. So this girl just removed all her feelings for me overnight. I feel like utter trash. I did not do anything wrong, and with this happening it makes hanging out with this group very hard because of my situation with her. do not get me wrong, her and i could try something again when she is ready. But this hurts me right now.What I am trying to get to is I feel like i do not have anyone. This depression is taking a huge toll on me mentally. I have had many suicidal thoughts before and i have always mentioned it with my brother or someone I am extremely close with. But i have not said anything to anyone this time, which scares me. I truly have not been able to enjoy anything this summer.To add to this, i have lost 16 pounds this summer solely off of my appetite.I am alone with my own thoughts literally all day and this situation with the girl makes everything 5x harder.

Still in the house of the women who took his side when he tried doing what he had done, while talking shit behind his back about him. Still in the house of twofaced individuals who maintain the image of good, just, kind, outgoing people.

I do not even know if I am even remembering things correctly or if I am making things up. I have no proof of being beaten, of being yelled at, of being manipulated, of being persistently made fun of, I have none of that. Hell, the only reason I am working right now is because of my father. Of the same father who was only present in my life to berate me, to beat me, to try to kill me. Granted, I have failed a lot throughout my life, I did not study at all, I was at my PC all day, so I sort of do entertain the idea of me deserving all this. I did waste my life and academically, I did not do shit. I dropped out of college too and I feel like the only reason they have accepted this decision was because they just all gave up on me. My mother, father, sister, grandmother they just do not give a shit anymore and it makes me miss the yelling, the beating, the threats, because at least then, they had cared about me. And now my only plan is to move out. Not even to a different town, just a different place. But what about after that? I will still be a friendless loner with no life skills, with no life experiences, with no talents, with a minimum wage job, what then? I will still be alone, all by myself. Maybe I deserve that.

I have always said to myself I am just sad, lonely or whatever. Now I am scared to go. Scared that there is actually nothing wrong with me and this is who I am. Scared that I cannot be fixed and will be like this forever. Majority of depression stories have some kind of trigger, some kind of trauma.

These thoughts and feelings of sadness, numbness, apathy just slowly creeped over me and now have swallowed me whole. Things I used to enjoy no longer interest me.

"I believe that materialism, technology and social media is really fucking people up. There seems to be a level of competition with everyone, wanting to look the best, have the best things and post it all over social media for gratification. Wearing expensive brands seems to be the norm. People spending all of their money on ridiculously expensive clothing and jewellery all for a social media platform, for likes, for this shallow gratification. The cliche saying of loving things and using people seems to be getting stronger and stronger. I feel the worlds priorities seem to be so out of balance. We have everything we need for a happy life here on earth and still the system and the way we live we have created this competitive, unloving, uncaring, selfish, greedy society.Idk, maybe I just was not built for this.

Visual Snow Syndrome that progresses and continues to become more severe for no apparent reason, afterimages that torture and fill up my vision both positive and negative. Light sensitivity, warping you name it. it is supposed to become stable after 2 years, which seems like a lie considering it is only gotten worse for the past 4. Then, there is tinnitus. I hear multiple **5 to 6 sounds** spread across my ears, permanently. All different, some even sound reactant. Hissing, ringing, ""morse code"". And it never stops. And then to top it all off...**Hyperacusis** that has gotten worse very recently. Something that has taken me well over the edge of ""Oh fuck it all"". I was still considered strong prior to this funnily enough, so long as I had my music to escape and whatever vision I had to play videogames or watch movies etc, I will be fine I thought. Then god once again fucked me, worsening something that only 0.6%(?) of people on this earth has. Sound sensitivity. It is fucking torture. I can no longer do or enjoy basic things that people use to escape a nightmare. Everything, has been taken away from me. And I did not have much left. Not only are two of these conditions considered rare, but they are underfunded by a society that does not give a fuck about unhealthy people. And then you see it on the news, two billionaires using money for flying out to space for shits n giggles. Leaving you behind. Which only results in demoralization that people like that can exist while everyday you wake up looking into a mirror as a broken husk. Ending my life would be a genuine blessing. I have given up on both myself and society as a whole. Just fuck this shitstain world. God is wanting me to suffer, my life is literally a nightmare",Suicidal

"I just find myself so useless. I have been dealing with social anxiety, others may find it easy to go out to work, but not for me. it is really stressful whenever I think about going out to work. Even if I have a job, I find it meaningless too, to wake up at 7am for a 9am job, reaches home at 7pm, only a few hours left to do my stuff and then sleeping early cos you got to get up early next day again, that goes on for the rest of my life which I do not like it at all. I tried to sell some stuff online to support myself financially, but that is not working out. Now that our breadwinner has passed on, we are left with a huge debt for housing loan, and also suffering from monthly utilities bills. Family and relatives only tell me to go out to work so that I can have an income to support the family. Others look down on me. Since I am so useless, I am slowly losing my will to live.

Now as an adult I am having trouble being emotionally stable, I feel helpless at these feelings, and depression takes over. I know I cannot change the past, but now I have difficulties making adult friends, because I was so limited, I was not allowed to have friends over, My parents fought with family so even family connection was limited. My dad was always angry if I came out of my room he was yelling at how useless I was, so now I realize Idk how to be with people. People think I am so weird. I am so tiered of having such a hard time at being human, I crave emotional connection and I do not have it. I used to think of everything so religiously because that was embedded into me, now I am always doubting if god exist and if life is pointless. Its hard to stay positive, idk what to do with my life and if I do not do anything doctorly I am a failure to my parents. What is up with foreign parents wanting all their kids to be doctors?

But something in me always told me to keep fighting. That something has burned out. I can feel a new depth of hollowness in me. I am assured there is no more love life for me. Best part, the woman I love, she met someone. And I think he is good for her. I have not seen her happy for so long. And I do not want to destroy her life too. In movies we see the hero, throwing away everything to confess his love, but in real life, I have nothing to begin with, to throw away. I do not have any money, lost my business, seperated from my wife, who I wish is happy. So you see, there is nothing more for me. I have done my part in this world. Only thing to do is, disappear. I just want to vanish from this world as soon as possible. If anyone can help me, let me know. Just a fast death. that is the only thing I genuinely genuinely wish for me. Getting off Reddit.

"Hi, this is a new account I made just to say this. I have been suffering from depression for a while and that has caused me so many things, I have almost commited suicide before, I have gotten an F, a few W's and Incompletes in college but somehow I managed to survive.On top of my problems, there is a lot going on in my life. I am doing a (summer) college class for the 3rd time and a few days into it, my good friend unexpectedly died. I have a midterm tomorrow which is 30% of my grade and because of this horrible news, I have been depressed, unable to function and I have to make up 10 two hour lectures for the midterm tomorrow. On top of this, due to the pandemic, my father has lost his job and we are about to sell my house because we need the money.The thing is, I have a loving and supportive family, my friends really care about me and I know a lot of people will be affected if I am not here. All I can think about is how to I die and not make it look like I committed suicide. I feel really alone even though I know that there are so many people who care. But I still called my friend because I needed warmth? but I just could not tell him what was wrong with me so I just hung up.

I have had weeky therapy for over 6 months but it just is not working.

"Hi all,I have had depression since I was a kid. I have a long family history of bipolar, borderline. It was talked about and my parents have mental health issues, but the only thing I was ever treated for is ADHD.In the past, I used to have pretty bad GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and had a lot of panic attacks. I would also have some really severe points of depression where I was pretty debilitated for 1-2 weeks, but I have found for the most part my more severe points of anxiety/depression have diminished.I do have some substance issues, mainly drinking which is not a daily thing but once i start i cannot stop, just heavy binge drinking. I did used to use quite a bit of c\*ke which was a big personal and financial issue, but I have curbed that for the most part. A few of my friends actually had an intervention with me about my drinking, when I get past the point of no return with alcohol I get extremely depressive and just talk about dark stuff in my past and just want to take any and all drugs. My friends were basically like every time you drink you do this and its too much for us etc, we cannot deal w this and you need to stop. so severer depression recently has manifested itself more in substances than in my day to day.however, my day to day is meaningless and empty. I do well at work because its the one thing I am a perfectionist about, but the way I live is so depressing. I have nothing to look forward to, I wake up, go to work, go home, watch tv, sleep. Sometimes have friends over for drinks.I cannot take care of myself, I can barely maintain personal hygiene like showering or doing laundry, i have garbage all over my apartment. I have no energy or motivation to do anything. Something traumatic happened to me about 5 years ago, since then I have gained 100 pounds just with binge eating.I cannot even look at myself in the mirror, let people take photos of me. Before I had insecurities, but I still wanted to be seen. My friends do not even invite me out for day activities because on my days off I am in bed till like 5pm.I am an artist, that is the only thing i care about. i have not been able to make work in almost 2 years because the burden of it feels like too much. I feel like a fraud, like i do not even know where to start.I am not majorly depressed right now, I have been there where all I want is to die, but its more just like day in and day out meaninglessness. I dissociate a lot, always going through the motions and i feel like I am wasting my life.I am really uncomfortable with doctors, i have not been to one since 2012 lol because of a bad experience. Overall though I can barely take care of myself so scheduling appointments is something I have been delaying for years.but for those in a similar situationon antidepressants, ssris etc -has this helped you deal with the day to day? I know i should make a lifestyle change and put more effort into being happier, but it just feels so daunting. I am wondering if beginning with a prescription will get me to the point where i can begin to address the areas of my life i need to work on. pls share your medication experience/how it impacted you! i feel like its the only way for me to get somewhere because i feel like I have been completely stagnant. will antidepressants help me, or do i need to make a lifestyle change?",Depression

I think I should give up. that is fertile ground for a new start. Well. Yeah. So. &amp;#x200B;TLDR; How can I care again? How can I genuinly enjos something?

"Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city, an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me, I absolutely hate the work that I have to do. Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it, it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my way-out ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni, my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness, isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out, hang-out, eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. And I am stuck. Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here, I literally do not have anything back home. No friends, no group, no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life, at 23 when I should be living my best years, gain all these experiences and feel young, I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up, it is always the same pathetic record - me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated high-school. I honestly just do not know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan B's is not it? I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than film-making. Unfortunately in my home-country there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at. it is hard to explain but I just feel it. What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my so-called professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do, but cannot. It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading, books make me feel even worse. I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in. All the laughs, all the friends, all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things, being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do, places I would want to visit but here I am. Maybe I am just delusional, maybe I have high-functioning depression, I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have. I just feel like I am not right for this world, I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that.

"Okay so I have been feeling down for a long time. Each day is a battle. People around me think I am doing okay and each time I reach out to my friends, they end up comparing my problems to others who are even less fortunate. that is not how it works tho, its a bad idea to compare peoples problems, it makes one feel unheard and neglected.Anywho, I feel like I am tired with life, some people are fighters, good for them, some are just losers like me who call it a life when thrown dilemmas and difficulties at. Its not like my problems are not solvable, its just that I am in a bad position rn and I do not think I can deal with this for the next 60-70 years of my life. I am in huge student debt (about to be, I am 18), my startup is going to fail probably (yet again because no one wants to invest in anything that does not inspire confidence), my love life is a dry land because I never have enough time and when I do, I just deal with disappointments. I am sorry if this got drifted away from the title.So yes, the title, I have planned the next step once and for all, I am not doing it yet, I do not want to do it in the vicinity of my parents, my plan is to do it when I move to uni soon, a place where I am far away from anyone I ever knew. I have written a detailed note on why I am doing it and okay yes I know these problems can be solved, I am not a total dummy, its just that I have lost the will for everything. Everything. I do not want to deal with an ounce of the life I have apparently been blessed with.Even if I seek more help aggressively to prevent my decision, its going to delay it but I have been at it for years since I was probably 15 or 16 so yes if not now then in the near future I am going to do it. I am not doing any of that to garner attention. Hell Id be happy if people thought I just disappeared but that would be rude to leave without at least a note.Just wanted to get this out.

"I am a little ffd up rn so if I do not make sense I am sorry. anyway, I used to have a job at a restaurant back in 2019 and was a solo host / busser. the environment was pretty high stress because of all the duties I had to cover at once (including online orders). I had another job as a janitor not to long ago, it had it is perks sometimes, but we were short staffed so work was heavy. even so, I feel like I could have done the work in my sleep. it was so simple and repeated that I started to dissociate really fast almost every day. it made it really easy to think about some really dark stuff directed at myself. the restaurant job was too high stress for me. every time I had to handle money as well was really bad because I would be shaking so much that the change would fall. I just do not know what kind of job is going to be relaxed but not to where I am by myself but also not going to be stressful.

"I have been depressed for a really long time, essentially the majority of my life. In the midst of my current depressive episode I just notice how far back it actually goes and I have gotten 9 or 10 out of 16 years I have been living with this. I want to have a future, I want to have kids and a start a family when I am older, be successful, etc. I do not think I can do any of that if I am depressed at random. Every depressive episode can be triggered by even a mild inconvenience. My depression is only getting worse. Every year I lose the will to live more and more. Its been so long and I will need alot of therapy to get over it but that is the difficult part. By the time I can afford therapy I am scared it will be too late. My parents know about my problems but they ignore it. They know about the self harming, the suicidal thoughts, a rough idea of how long I have been depressed, etc and they do not believe its bad. I have asked for therapy multiple times and its been dismissed. Working a part time job that will allow me to afford therapy in college is iffy, affording therapy fresh out of college is iffy, whether or not I will ever be able to afford therapy is iffy. I see people, on tv, in books, in the news, online, even on subreddits like these, with children; and they constantly express how depressed they are and whether or not they can live for their children. I do not want that to be me. I do not want to grow up never getting the help I need and when I do someday have children, they lose their mother to suicide. Or even worse they grow up with a mother who is depression affects her ability to parent; and she ends up lashing out at her children or being incapable of taking care of them the way they need all the time.I want to try to heal in my life, and I know I cannot do it alone or even with support from loved ones. I know to heal I am going to need professional help, but I do not know if that is attainable. Healing before I can really live my life.",Depression
Sorry the title pretty much says it all. I finally fell asleep at about 1am because I was absolutely exhausted but I had this really morbid nightmare and woke up at 2:50. It was graphic as hell and really disturbing -- I was too scared to fall asleep again so now I am shattered. The worst part was waking up in a cold sweat and desperately longing for my ex. I just wanted to cling to them and sob. I was terrified and they are the first place my mind went to. I do not think they will ever understand how much they meant to me and how willing I was to stick around when things got hard. I just wanted them.

"I have been struggling with depression for my whole life and I have never had a girlfriend.I can suspect many reasons (but I do not really know the true answer) but the bottom line is it is never happened for me...I have never had the timing/luck to catch women when they are available...they are always taken. I have heard all ""the right person will come to you when you least expect it"" and other such nonsense...I do not believe in it...I am not that lucky.it is very hard meeting someone when you have depression/anxiety disorder. it is so hard to get the kind of confidence that women demand, and/or risk rejection and get the little esteem you have blown away. it is even harder to put on a fake display of pretening to be a happy version of yourself when deep inside I am screaming. And to keep doing this all the time, everytime.For those of you who have (or ever had) a gf or bf at one point, how did you manage to find yourself in a relationship? It is such a curiosity to me.

Knowing some day my friends and loved ones will die, some day I will graduate, some day my favorite shows will end, my favorite bands will disband, my boyfriends will leave me, etc; knowing all of it will all end is so distressing. If I make it to 18 I want to get tattoos. Even if they fade, I want to get SOMETHING that is permanent. Maybe when I am 18 things will be better and I can get a cool ""i got over my depression"" tattoo...I do not know if I can go that far, in all honesty. I do not want to kill myself but I do not want to keep seeing everything around me end. Whether its now or in the future I do not want to see the things I love end or die or disappear. I do not want to keep living and it feels like a matter of time before I suck it up and just end it, or until I find that painless method I have been hoping for, or until I come to terms with what happens after death.

"Life is an enigma. Yes, that is a bold statement, and no- I cannot explain what I mean.We are born- individually- each being biological miracles. Our consciousness is gifted to us by our parents and relatives. Our appearance: the product of those who are biologically linked to us. Our thoughts, emotions, our very existence was summoned from unknown origins. Scientists cannot explain our consciousness; they cannot explain how humans perceive reality the way they do. We are remarkable, unfathomable creatures.What separates us is our morals, thoughts, interests and preferences. Our single race has so much diversity. There is much good and there is much evil amongst us.I suppose the above was a bit of preface to what Id really like to write about.Its difficult to ponder a question for years upon years, knowing an answer is most definitely unattainable. The questions about our existence and meaning simply do not have answers- or perhaps they do- but they are so far out of our reach that we cannot imagine the answers to such questions.Why we were given the ability to question our existence, if an answer cannot be attained? Is it an error in biology- or is it a call for humans to figure out our origins and meanings? What if there is an answer?How can we choose what purpose our life holds? Most humans assign a purpose to themselves and chase that (for example, becoming a doctor and healing the sick)- others drift aimlessly- and others do not question their lifes meaning at all. I personally do not understand the latter people.What is it that I want?I have many things for which I am grateful for. I am blessed in many areas of life. I have a wonderful partner- who tries to show me how much he loves me each day- and a beautiful son. I have a home, access to clean water, food, electricity and free health care. I still have both of my parents- and I have not suffered the loss of any immediate family members. I am blessed in many instances but why is it that I do not feel fulfilled?What is it that I NEED to feel fulfilled? And what if its not possible to achieve that feeling of fulfilment? What if I spend my entire life yearning for that enigmatic, something greater?I know that I am meant for more. I feel it deep within myself- in fact- its the one truth which I have carried with me throughout my entire life. But I do not understand what it means. What is that more?

"My parents have been asking me a lot lately what I want to do with myself following high school and through adulthood, what I want to major in, careers I am interested in, etc. I always respond with the same answer, I do not know. Why do not I have any idea what I want to do in the future? Because I do not expect one for myself. I have zero motivation to get anywhere in life, I have no interests that are worth putting time and effort into to better myself. I have heard plenty of adults say its all downhill past 25 (age) well if that is true, what is the point of living past 25? Let the people who really have life aspirations get where they want to be, let them succeed and fulfill their goals, people like me just get in the way.

New people that come into my life seem so bland and uninteresting. Every interaction I have with another person feels so fake. All my responses in conversation feel rehearsed and not genuine; its like instead of actually being apart of a conversation, I am an actor that has their lines already memorized, or a robot with a set of pre-written responses. At the same time, I have developed a very short temper when it comes to talking to people. An otherwise benign statement or conversation topic will instantly sour my mood and when people make mistakes I just cannot seem to let it go and in my head I actively hold it against them. Everyone disappoints me. Maybe I should just isolate myself from society for a while and cut out all of my friends and family.

"I have the most supportive parents I could ask for, they do everything for me. Yet the best I could do for them is stay in bed and not kill myself, what a waste of energy for them. I am such a burden, I cannot do anything right I am so fucking useless and costly. I wish I could go back in time and somehow stop my birth from happening, that would save them the pain of having to deal with a pisslow child.I guess the best course of action now is to die, for the sake of everybody around me and myself. Someday, when I have it in me, I might hang myself in a ravine I used to like walking down. I do not see any downsides, my parents being able to focus on the kid that matters, more money, etc. And I am free from the pain. Why am I so ungrateful?",Suicidal
"I am not really suicidal anymore but Id still do it if I got the chance, you know?? I found some pills on my moms desk, and usually she locks them away, but they are there like I see them with my own eyes. I am debating on taking them but I have no idea what they are, and if they are some sort of important medicine I do not think I should take it like just I do not know what to do Ok, probably going to delete this, but I am stuck",Suicidal
"I am 21, a uni student from Canada. I live with my gf and I do not have any story or anything special to comment onI work as a retail employee for minimum wage, I have an average B- in my classes. I have no friends, except for my gf, and my family never calls or says hello. I am an absolute nobody with not a goddamn idea where my life is going.I have had depression for a long time. When I was 15 I tried to speak up about it; and about the suicidal thoughts too. All that really did was get me medicated, and forewarned that if I tried anything Id be locked up in a mental institute for life. I stopped trying to reach out after that. Ever since, I have been trying to convince myself not bite the bullet and take my own life. The meds just make me feel hollow, and any attempt I make trying to improve my mental state just eases my mind temporarily. I do not want sympathy, I am fact, I do not know what I want. I feel like I am just floating through life, but every second I reflect upon who I am I just hate myself. I am a shitty bf, a terrible son, a nobody who means nothing in the world but another average face in the crowd. Another environment destroyer, another annoyance, useless coworker, skipped Reddit post, another fucking nothing. I wake up every morning and ask myself why I am alive, and every morning I cannot answer that question. If I kill myself nothing changes, and the few people that notice when I die will move on and probably live better lives anyways. My gf is terrific but I am holding her down away from her dreams, and my parents hardly care if I am alive anyways. What am I worth? Why am I here? Creeping thoughts",Suicidal
"Sorry big rant : So I have had depression for almost 6 years, or I would consider it depression I never had it diagnosed or anything but I have lost all motivation and attempted suicide a few times, I still self harm time to time when I feel really shitty but I have never really told anyone, the only people I have told have only also reflected how they have self harmed too and that their problems are worse than mine. I am 16, I have found better friends but I realized I am left out a lot, they have all been friends for years and I am new to their group, my depressions gotten better since I started recovering from my alopecia which I had since I was 8, but I feel as though my problems should not be even mentioned to them even though I know I need someone to talk to, their family issues are far worse than mine and whenever I mention something I am going through, they seem to ignore or brush it off, and whenever I support their problems I realize that they have it worse and I feel as though I should not talk to them about anything I am going through because it would only stress them more. I love them and they are good friends and so kind but I just think I am drowning alone I do not feel like my problems are as important",Suicidal
"I guess this is just a vent. I feel like I have hit a new low. Every other time i felt depressive episodes hit the hardest, it was mostly situational. But for the last month and a half or so it hit me like a truck and nothing really terrible happened to trigger this. I feel like no ones really noticed and the ones i do tell just seem confused because I am not physically hurting myself, I am not crying all the time or lashing out like i normally do when it gets bad. But this is the worst I have felt in a long time. I do not even know why I am sad, and it turns into frustration and then anger and then hopelessness. One thing that maybe is not helping is my personal relationships. I am taking a break from romantic things as i had a failed talking stage fairly recently, and even though he and i only talked for a brief period of time and its been a while since i cut things off i cannot get over it. Its affected me way more than it should. I also feel like I am pushing my friends away without even trying. I am not myself right now and i know they can sense it. I do not think I am as fun to be around, if I ever even was. This is the first time I have been this alone. I feel like without a person to swoon over or focus on I am just an empty she will. I know i need to be alone and work on myself, but i feel so stuck. I feel horrible but i cannot cry, I cannot even express how i feel to people and i do not think anyone understands just how terribly hopeless this feeling is. Every single small inconvenience or mistake i make beats me down and i do not know how much more i can handle. I am becoming bitter, I do not even feel like I am myself anymore. I just want to get better and I am tired of hearing that I just need to go on a walk once a day and eat fruit and journal. I am tired of taking medicines that do not work. I know that there are things I can do to get better but i do not even know where to start. Its getting bad",Depression

"I am 27m I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. My childhood was non existent, middle school and high school I was a loner, the only reason people invited me into their groups was because they knew my twin but they would not talk to me. One girl that I somewhat talked to, we had an inside joke that I did not have friends I had acquaintances because no one was really my friend. It was a joke at first but eventually it became real. College I dropped out of during my second year after failing so many classes I just decided school was not for me. But after dropping out I got a part time job and after a couple years I saved up some money and decided to quit I do not know why I just could not take it there anymore. I then moved back with my parents when Covid started but my depression got worse. I was lonely with no friends or anyone to talk to and I ended up texting my ex that I broke up with (to me she is the one that got away) at first it went great we were laughing and talking catching up but after awhile I think she just got more annoyed with me and I honestly never knew what I did wrong and she would never tell me which was never my intention. But I know it was stupid of me to text her, I just wanted to talk to her, catch up or something. I have never had a friend or really talked to anyone. Mostly since my social skills are terrible and people get bored of me quick. I tried to hide my loneliness by keeping myself busy with personal projects like keyboard building, reading and also decided to go back to school and learn programming because it looked interesting even though I have no knowledge about it. But honestly no matter how hard I try to keep myself busy I just end up feeling so down. I cannot even get out of bed sometimes. I just do not know what to do anymore. I feel like I am the problem, everyone says I am just being lazy that I just do not want to do anything and I am a bum. Are they right? Am I the problem or am I just depressed?",Depression

"Idk, I just feel like I need to say this, my mental state is going really really fucking fast downhill really fucking quickly. I have been struggling with this shit as long as I can remember, and I honestly can barely take it anymore. I have no clue why I have let myself live so long.my mental health is beyond shit, cronic depression or whatever the fuck it is. My social life, the only thing in life I have been clinging on to the past year, is also beyond shit. All of the friends I thought were my friends all ghosted me at once over the summer, even ones who promised me they would not ghost me like they always do. My home life is fucking chaotic and it only makes things several several times worse, believe it or not I am having some struggles when it comes to just being able to cope with the fucking abuse that gets thrown at me, like my therapist wants me to do. My physical health is the same, idk if I was just born different or whatever but my body's just fucked up. I am always in constant pain no matter what I do and it is just becoming too much to handle, you know, to the point of thinking death would be better than this.I can go on and on complaining about this shit, but apparently it is bad enough that I have been told to kms. Because it would put me out of my misery- not to be mean or anything. Yeah-Last time I was in the mental hospital for wanting to commit die, after kind of ranting about my home life my roommate was telling me that if I wanted to kill myself, they would support me fully.I have literally heard someone have a full on MENTAL BREAKDOWN because they thought that trying to convince me to not kill myself was selfish. Because they felt horrible for just making me suffer longer, and did not know if dying would just be the best option for me.I have shared these thoughts with people close to me and it usually ends with them giving up on me. I cannot count the amount of times I have heard stuff like this.Tell me death would not be the solution to all my problems. Tell me ending my life would not be by far the most effective way of no longer suffering, and fixing my problems. Tell me. I cannot count the amount of times I have been told to kill myself. No, not by bullies, but by people who care about me.",Suicidal

"This has been the worst fucking year of my life. Fucking 34 years on this planet and nothing takes the fucking cake like this. No friends to vent to, anxiety rushing through my head, ocd replaying the same fucking convos repeatedly. I cannot deal with all of this heartache. I lose my two year relationship. My family splits apart. Me and my girls rebuild. Meets another girl she breaks our heart. And yoyos it back and forth for months as we wait first one comes back and we give her a chance. She leaves us again. Second girl comes back and continues toying with being committed. I lose my shit and had enough of the games and leaves. Meet another woman she seems great but taken. Refuses to leave her dead end relationship for us and prefers to cheat. that is not for us. Meet another woman like her alot but we agree it would not work. Person we dated before wants to hang out nothing serious (yay...). Met an amazing woman but she is not sure if she wants to be with us. Second girl comes back again. And says sorry. Then tonight confesses the guy friend I warned her about and she was foul for taking his number in the first place when she never took others which itself is a red flag, well they while she is been gone for this month have been dating and making out etc. But yet confesses her love and wants to be with us. Says it is not a big deal but refuses to lose him. Yet says it is just fun while she is on her journey until she is ready to settle. I am not ok with that. Fuck that shit.My mother is possibly dying too.My girls are sick and struggling to support me emotionally. They are pretty much numb to all of this. They hide their feelings well. But I can tell their hurt also. Our son is sick.I am back to self harm.I am getting addicted to weed again as I self medicate daily to try and keep functioning.I am bursting at the seams and want to fucking die. I promised myself I would not get back to a suicidal place but yup I am here. Daddy's home. I swear I am going to fucking do it. I am so much over all of this pain and heartache. All of this grief and strife. I am done with it. I want to fucking jump in the river and drown. I cannot keep going another day like this. No friends to talk to, no family to talk to, and the girls cannot emotionally be there as they are not those types of individuals to know how to adequately be there for someone with my level of depression.

"I grew up in a very abusive household, and my friends also hPpened to be physically and emotionally abusive narcissists. So when i was 15, my father saw i had a few cuts on my arms and his response was to yell, ""wtf is that. (I replied with, ""stress"".) *he then gets right into my face*... STRESSED, I am THE ONE that is STRESSED. I WORK ALL DAY, I HAVE 3 DIFFERENT BUISNESSES I DEAL WITH. IF YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN, you will FUCKEN SEE WHAT HAPPENS"".Since i was a child he is been training me everyday since i was a kid id go to wwork with him, untill i started school. Then it was jist the summmers. And then it was weekends and summers by the time i was 12. I jad become severely overweight and only haad 2 physically and emotionally abusive friends. By the time i was 14, i was essentially running one of the buisnesses myself. Yet he acts like i have all this fucken free time to do everything he needs when I am trying to have my own life. He goes, ""you can do whatever you want"" but then also forces me to work under him, and underpays me when he finally made me become an employee since we were lacking manpower at the time. Anything I have ever said was ignored, constantly belittling. All i feel is emptiness at this point. And finally realizing that my friend was a fucking sociopathic rapist. I mean i always new he was a bad person but i never fully understood. I have a very child like, bubbly personality ehich was just ripe for abuse i guess. I may have bpd, i need to see a therapist but i really just want to give up on life. Idk. I am 24 now. I finally kicked out the toxic ppl in my life after starting to find my voice but I am still stuck with my father because of work and while it seems like hes trying. It also seems fake whenever there is an actual problem he reverts back. The amount of gaslighting, manipulation, scapegoating, belittling, bullying I have taken. I have so many stupid storys like being ditched, hit, picked on, played with by friends and family. And all i did was take it because that is all I have ever done. And i was yelled at otherwise. For fuxks sake, I have been ditched at a piehole pizza because i had the keys and my friend had the food, i went to unlock my door, he saw and rushed at my with his fist in the air ready to punch me, i flinched and tossed the keys over his head. It fell and broke this plastic compass his father got him. His mom and dad divorced. because from what he told me, he was an alcoholic. But they still see eachother alot.

I am not looking for sympathy, I have just never felt so alone in my life. I love my husband and children and am so grateful for them, but there is just this hole in me. I want to know what happened to my mother. From what I have heard about her, she just had a very sad life. I think about her often, and I hope she feels that, wherever she is.

"I found the spot I want to jump from. It will take me approximately 3.36 seconds to hit the water. I hope I pass out before I do. It sounds painful, the act of hitting the water. I have read, over and over, the two ways of dying after jumping. Sometimes it makes me feel nauseous, sometimes it brings peace to imagine my body breaking up like that, like a final definitive proof of my existence.

It does not matter if I have money, if I have an amazing job I love, if I am funny, if I am smart, if I am kind. It does not matter how much love I have to give, how much effort I put in, or how far Id go just to feel what its like to have love reciprocated. I am tired of reaching out to people who I know will not miss me, or will just tell me I need to take meds just so they do not have to deal with me. I could do everything perfectly and to everyone I have ever loved, they would still ask for more and go off with someone else anyways. Death can end this sorry excuse for an existence. I do not care if it gets better. I do not care if there is nothing after, and I do not care the irreversible damage my death will because. I want it. I want it now more than I have wanted anything in my whole life. More than travel, more than money, more than love. I simply want it to end because its become abundantly clear I am not of value to anyone and never will be. I just want it to end. The torment, the pain. The emptiness, the silence. All of it. there will be a smile on my face when they find me, because the only peace I can have left in this life is knowing that its finally over, that I can rest.

"I am 16 and this happened when i was 13. this girl invited me over to her house and we had already had sex several times before. i think she said to me that she did not feel like having sex but in my mind i saw it as an opportunity for sex because i was an asshole. when i came over to her house I layed on her bed and we began cuddling. i asked her ""hey want to have sex"" about 3 times in the span of an hour so i was being persistent. i was not using force or threats or anything. after the 3rd time she rejected me i then said to her ""I will go slow"" and she then responded with ""alright sure"". i was not sure if she was bothered or not I am not sure. she then layed down and i then went inside of her and it felt good, so i started to go faster and faster and she sounded like she was enjoying it. why was i starting to go faster? I am not sure honestly but my intent definitely was not bad I did not want to harm her. i guess i just started to go faster because of how good it felt and i was really horny. well anyways 15 seconds after the sex started she told me to stop and i did right away. as soon as i heard her say it i stopped it. she then said that she was sorry for ending it early and she said she was just worried about getting pregnant and I told her its fine. we then hung out for like 20 minutes and then i left. i feel like i will always be a bad person no matter what. i really wish i never met this girl so i would not of done what i did. a year after she told me that she had sex with 9 other guys and that those guys dicks were bigger than mine am i a rapist",Depression
